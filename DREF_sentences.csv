612|On 27 March 2017, medium to high-intensity rains and storms began to hit Argentina, leaving heavy production and material losses in their wake.|MDRAR013
613|A total of 15 provinces were affected.|MDRAR013
614|A total of 39,777 people across Argentina were affected from late March to early April 2017.|MDRAR013
615|The following provinces were among the most affected: Jujuy (south), Salta (north), Tucumán (south), Córdoba (Villa General Belgrano and the Paravachasca Valley), San Juan (Ullum, 25 de Mayo and Valle Fértil), Catamarca (Santa Rosa and Valle Viejo neighbourhood in El Portezuelo; Ambato and Los Corderos and Las Lajas neighbourhoods in Paclín), Chubut (Comodoro Rivadavia) and Buenos Aires (Mar del Plata).|MDRAR013
616|In June and July 2017, heavy rains caused various rivers to overflow, leading to flooding in the cities of Concordia and Concepción del Uruguay (Entre Ríos province) and in several cities in Corrientes province.|MDRAR013
617|Argentine Red Cross (ARC) branches launched operations to respond to these emergencies, providing assistance to more than 200 families.|MDRAR013
618|On 29 March 2017, intense rains caused flooding in several neighbourhoods in Chubut province.|MDRAR013
619|The ARC branch in Chubut suffered mud and water damage.|MDRAR013
620|Some 100 people were housed in various collective centres, which were managed by neighbourhood organizations and received supplies from the municipal and provincial governments.|MDRAR013
621|On 30 March, the governor of Chubut province declared a 120-day weather emergency.|MDRAR013
622|A new storm packing 45 to 50-kph winds hit Comodoro Rivadavia on 7 April, dumping almost 100 millimetres of rain over a period of 24 hours, killing two people and directly and indirectly affecting 100,000 others, worsening the already precarious situation.|MDRAR013
623|Tucumán was the second most affected province nationwide, as rainfall levels in its southern areas were double the normal monthly average for that time of year.|MDRAR013
624|On 30 March, Tucumán's provincial government declared a multi-issue emergency (water, social, community and agricultural) for Simoca, Graneros, Alberdi, La Cocha, La Invernada, Lamadrid and Taco Ralo.|MDRAR013
625|In Lamadrid, 80 per cent of its approximately 5,000 people suffered damages.|MDRAR013
626|Most of the population has since returned to their homes, while others temporarily left and a small minority permanently abandoned their homes.|MDRAR013
627|On 8 April, intense rainfall began to fall in the city of Mar del Plata in Buenos Aires province.|MDRAR013
628|By 10 April, 241 mm had fallen over a period of 48 hours (monthly average for the area is 70 mm), affecting a total of 23 neighbourhoods in the city of Belgrano, including the neighbourhoods of Belgrano, Autódromo and 2 de Abril.|MDRAR013
629|On 7 April, the mayor of Valle Fértil in San Juan province declared a weather emergency due to the increasing rains and their impact.|MDRAR013
630|According to Province Civil Protection, the most affected areas were Baldes de Astica, Baldes de Funes and Baldes del Sur de Chucuma, which are all in the southern Valle Fértil, affecting 50 families.|MDRAR013
631|Flooding in these communities left several families incommunicado, requiring the delivery of food via helicopter.|MDRAR013
648|In January 2018, heavy rains dropped 290 mm of cumulative rainfall in Presidencia Roque Sáenz Peña (January , the city’s rainiest month, normally receives an average of 100 mm of rain), causing flooding that isolated various sections of the city, disrupted the electrical supply and destroyed the city’s sewerage system.|MDRAR014
649|Some homes and public buildings were inundated with between 10 cm and 150 cm of water.|MDRAR014
650|The affected neighbourhoods were the following: Santa Mónica, Tiro Federal, Ginés Benítez, Monseñor de Carlo, Santa Elena, Hipólito Yrigoy en, Sáenz Peña, Milenium, San José, Piñeiro, Nala, Pablo VI and Quinta Ocho.|MDRAR014
651|On 24 January, the media began covering the emergency, and a “State of Hydric, Economic, Productive and Social Emergency” was declared.|MDRAR014
652|All the municipal and provincial government agencies responded to this emergency, and the national government, through the Secretariat of Civil Protection (which is part of the Ministry of Security), mobilized staff to the affected zone.|MDRAR014
653|During the operation, two of the collective centres had difficulties providing potable water and with solid waste management in their bathrooms.|MDRAR014
654|Due to this situation, some people suffered illnesses such as gastrointestinal pain and skin rashes.|MDRAR014
655|People who were sheltered in some of these centres had no access to sanitary services, and there were some temporary difficulties in obtaining food due to challenges in accessing the affected region.|MDRAR014
656|Additionally, the collapse of the sewage system producing stagnant water and foul odours.|MDRAR014
657|Flood water levels began to drop some weeks after the intense rains subsided, stagnant water in the streets finally drained away, homes began to dry out and basic services were restored.|MDRAR014
664|Starting on 31 January 2018, severe storms dropped more than 200mm of rain in the northern part of the Salta province in north-western Argentina, which coupled with rainfall in the upper basin of the Bermejo and Pilcomayo Rivers (Paraguay-Bolivia border) caused a rise in water levels; additionally, discharges from the already high Chimeo River in Bolivia in turn caused flooding in Salta areas along the banks of the Pilcomayo River.|MDRAR015
665|Water levels far exceeded historical levels, triggering an alert and a corresponding evacuation.|MDRAR015
666|More than 17,000 people were affected, of whom 7,000 were displaced and 100 people were left isolated and uncommunicated.|MDRAR015
667|Overflows from the Pilcomayo River flooded entire areas, especially the indigenous communities of Wichi, Chorote and Toba.|MDRAR015
668|Localities such as Santa Victoria Este were left isolated, as flooding compromised the city’s containment rings.|MDRAR015
669|Flooding also affected communities’ livelihoods such as small livestock production (mainly goats, sheep and pigs), subsistence agriculture and fishing.|MDRAR015
670|Water levels fell very slowly, making it difficult for families with flooded dwellings to return home.|MDRAR015
671|Some affected communities, especially indigenous ones had to relocate elsewhere as directed by their cacique (community leader), as is their custom; once they relocated, these communities were forced to identify other natural resources with which to resume livelihoods such as fishing, agriculture and animal husbandry.|MDRAR015
672|Several stretches of Route 54 were damaged during the initial flooding and again around mid-operation, and national Road Service personnel were responsible for repairing the damage.|MDRAR015
673|By the end of the operation, all the affected communities had returned to their places of origin, except for some Monte Carmelo and La Curvita residents who decided to resettle in a new location, and the government later installed basic services such as energy and water for these residents; some Santa María residents have chosen to resettle along stretches of Route 54.|MDRAR015
674|Both the national and provincial governments are about to undertake infrastructural projects in affected localities to prevent future flooding from the Pilcomayo River; however, despite disaster prevention and preparedness efforts, indigenous groups from the Santa Victoria Este region and northern Argentina continue to be extremely vulnerable.|MDRAR015
675|According to government indicators, 89 per cent of the population report some type of unmet basic need; furthermore, only 30 per cent have access to education, housing conditions continue to be very precarious (especially for relocated communities that will not be returning to their lands), health services are scarce and do not provide full coverage, and animal husbandry, farming and fishing practices remain at a subsistence level.|MDRAR015
735|In Burkina Faso, heavy rainfall, which started in June and continued until 23 July 2016 led to widespread flooding across four of the 13 regions in the country.|MDRBF013
736|It has been estimated that up to 10,260 people were affected, with ten injures and four deaths reported.|MDRBF013
737|Initial response and support were provided by the government that was however, overwhelmed with the continued rains.|MDRBF013
738|The latest areas to be affected on 18 23 July were in Ouagadougou, Kadiogo Province, in the centre region of Burkina Faso, with floods which affected 929 families (4,235 people) in six administrative districts.|MDRBF013
739|It was reported to be as severe as the floods that affected the capital in 2009, which was the worst in the city`s history.|MDRBF013
740|Flood waters washed away people`s belongings, destroyed food stocks, savings, livestock and petty trade materials, while houses were completely or partially destroyed, latrines inundated and water sources contaminated.|MDRBF013
741|Most of the affected population sought shelter in schools, where the hygiene conditions were precarious, and conducive to the outbreak of cholera epidemics and other waterborne diseases.|MDRBF013
742|During the initial assessment of the humanitarian needs of the affected people, cases of diarrhoea among children were reported.|MDRBF013
743|On 5 August 2016, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) released CHF 194,005 from the Disaster Relief & Emergency Fund (DREF) to support the Burkinabe Red Cross Society (BRCS) to respond to the needs of the flood affected population.|MDRBF013
744|The DREF operation was intended to provide 4,235 people (929 families) across a range of sectors (relief, shelter, as well as water, sanitation and hygiene promotion), over a period of three months.|MDRBF013
745|One month before the operation ended a request to revise the DREF and extend the operational timeframe by one month was introduced.|MDRBF013
746|However, the request was not granted.|MDRBF013
747|It is worth explaining here that the extension would have enabled the assistance of additional communities also affected by the floods but not considered during the first needs assessment conducted at the onset of the operation.|MDRBF013
748|Indeed, a second field needs assessment conducted in Kadiogo Province had revealed that the needs of additional families needed to be taken in charge.|MDRBF013
749|As for the budget its revision would have had allowed to take into account donations to the operation.|MDRBF013
750|Indeed, the Sahel Country Cluster had stock in Dakar which needed to be liquidated and was donated to the operation at no cost.|MDRBF013
751|This DREF has been replenished by Belgian Red Cross and the Belgian Government.|MDRBF013
752|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID) the Medtronic, Zurich and Coca Cola Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRBF013
753|The IFRC, on behalf of the Burkinabe Red Cross Society would like to extend many thanks to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRBF013
785|This situation negatively affects the physical condition of animals and the availability of their products.|MDRBF014
786|Analysis of the current and projected food situation from August to September shows the province (Oudalan) in a food crisis situation (phase 3).|MDRBF014
787|Furthermore, the heavy rainfall recorded late July in the province of Oudalan, plunged hundreds of people into disarray and left deep traces.|MDRBF014
788|This situation indicates that there have been two casualties.|MDRBF014
789|Approximately 882 people (117 households) were displaced, 85 houses and 47 Latrines destroyed, 101 small ruminants washed away, eight donkeys reported missing, 18 mattresses washed away, unusable sleeping facilities, kitchen utensils destroyed and washed away.|MDRBF014
790|The victims from the affected locations are relocated to foster families whose capacity of welcoming more relatives remain inadequate.|MDRBF014
791|To alleviate the suffering, the Burkina Faso Red Cross, with the support of the Spanish Red Cross, organized a non-food items distribution to 112 households.|MDRBF014
792|These non-food items (NFIs) consisted mainly of mats, blankets, cooking utensils, tarpaulins, jerry cans, buckets, soap, sanitary towels for women.|MDRBF014
793|Problems related to water, hygiene, sanitation, and habitat remain.|MDRBF014
794|Currently, with the lean season, some provinces of the country observe a deterioration in food and nutritional security and depletion of food stocks.|MDRBF014
795|Population displacement and insecurity aggravate the severity of food insecurity, resulting in an increased number of people in crisis and emergency situations.|MDRBF014
796|This is the case of households affected in the province of Oudalan.|MDRBF014
797|According to the country's Burkina Faso harmonized framework, 257,238 people are expected to be food and nutrition insecure in nine regions.|MDRBF014
798|In relation to this, the National Society has targeted 10 percent (25,723 people affected) of these food-insecure people for assistance, during the lean period from July to September 2017.|MDRBF014
799|The Emergency Fund (DREF) targets 8,452 people (part of 25,723) for direct food assistance during September, which represents 33 percent of the total target.|MDRBF014
800|While the DREF will help respond to the emergency, further funding is sought to attend the needs of the total target of 25,723 people.|MDRBF014
801|This emergency fund was requested to respond to the identified emergency pocket and lay the groundwork to develop a four-year program through more in-depth assessments and sound planning.|MDRBF014
802|While implementing the emergency response through this DREF, other funding mechanisms are considered to ensure continuity of the longer-term support which would be based on a preparedness and resilience approach.|MDRBF014
803|The long-term program will be integrated into the IFRC planning program.|MDRBF014
804|In fact, the Burkina Faso Red Cross is in line with the dynamics of the Movement's partners (IFRC, ICRC) and other partners in the Food Security cluster to provide an emergency response to households suffering from food and nutrition insecurity on the one hand and to strengthen the resilience of vulnerable households and the capacity of national actors to cope with shocks.|MDRBF014
805|These two objectives are aimed at addressing an integrated response including immediate food assistance during the lean season and, where conditions are favourable, strengthening or restoring livelihoods.|MDRBF014
806|Resilience is an integral part of this approach, as it provides an opportunity for affected populations to resist future shocks.|MDRBF014
875|In the afternoon of 29 March 2015, heavy rains caused floods and landslides in Muhuta, a commune of Bujumbura Rural Province, in Western Burundi.|MDRBI011
876|In Muhuta commune, the most affected collines (meaning “hill” in French) were Nyaruhongoka and Rutunga, located on the edge of Lake Tanganyika.|MDRBI011
877|The disaster-affected population was mainly made of farmers, fishermen and business men (around the “national road number 5”, between Bujumbura and Rumonge), who live in very poor villages in one of the most vulnerable areas in the cholera belt in southern of Burundi.|MDRBI011
878|According to the initial rapid assessment carried out by Burundi Red Cross Society (BRCS) volunteers, the floods and landslides resulted in the damage or destruction of 349 houses, 2 churches, 1 health centre, and 2 schools (1 primary and 1 secondary school) with the affected area entirely covered by mud and stones.|MDRBI011
879|In addition, other public infrastructure was also damaged, including 5 km of the national road number 5, between Bujumbura and Rumonge, which impacted on access to and from the affected area.|MDRBI011
880|Due to the destruction caused to national road number 5, people were forced to use Lake Tanganyika for the transportation of people and goods by pirogue, putting them under high risk of drowning.|MDRBI011
881|Following the disaster, the displaced population sought refuge in the houses of their relatives and neighbours, which put pressure on the limited resources of their hosts; while those whose homes didn’t collapse faced the risk of being swept away by rains, which were expected to continue until May 2015 (the end of the rainy season in Burundi).|MDRBI011
882|(Source: Department of Meteorology of Burundi – IGEBU)|MDRBI011
883|Many of these families left their homes, but others remained since they were trying to protect their goods and had nowhere to relocate.|MDRBI011
884|Furthermore, people in the area had just begun the planting season and the landslides destroyed their crops, as well as destroying shops, and killing livestock (goats and poultry).|MDRBI011
885|Additional damages included: Destruction of a small market place, Destruction of shops interrupting business activities, Destruction of a palm oil refining/production site, Destruction of a co-operative (goats, poultry and mushrooms).|MDRBI011
886|On 7 April 2015, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) released CHF 45,488 from the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to support the BRCS respond to the needs of the flood and landslide affected population, targeting 1,745 people with interventions in the areas of: restoration of family links, shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene promotion, for a period of three months.|MDRBI011
887|This DREF has been replenished by the Belgian Government and DG ECHO.|MDRBI011
888|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID) the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRBI011
889|The IFRC, on behalf of the Burundi Red Cross Society would like to extend its thanks to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRBI011
928|Starting from January 2018, intense rainfall was recorded in various areas of Burundi, including Gatumba, where flooding was recorded on 4 May 2018.|MDRBI014
929|Gatumba is located at approximately 12 kilometres from the city of Bujumbura.|MDRBI014
930|Like many others, this area is prone to periodic flooding and has a population comprising of farmers, livestock and small traders.|MDRBI014
931|A joint assessment conducted on 9 May by Burundi Red Cross Society, the government of Burundi, OCHA, WFP, UNICEF, IOM, NRC, Millions for One and PACT in six sites in Gatumba indicated that flooding in Gatumba was caused by overflow of two rivers, Rusizi 1 and 2, which are tributaries of Lake Tanganyika crossing Gatumba area from Kivu.|MDRBI014
932|The flooding had severe consequences with 12,956 people (2,143 men, 2,258 women and 8,555 children) and 2,133 houses affected in 9 locations as indicated in below table: Damage to infrastructure, including bridges and roads were also reported, which hampered access to the affected population.|MDRBI014
933|After a joint needs assessment, urgent support was required for 12,956 people in Gatumba in the following sectors; Shelter, WASH, livelihoods and basic needs, health and protection, gender and inclusion.|MDRBI014
934|In support of actions already undertaken by Burundi Red Cross Society and upon request of the NS, the IFRC launched a DREF operation for CHF 277,648 to reach approximately 30 percent of the affected population i.e. 3,885 people (777 households) in the areas of Shelter, WASH and PGI through this DREF operation for a period of 3 months.|MDRBI014
935|However, in August when the operation was about to close, the National Society noted that some nonfood items had not yet been delivered for the replenishment of Burundi Red Cross utilized stocks due to delays in shipping and customs clearance.|MDRBI014
936|As such, Burundi Red Cross Society was granted a two-month timeframe extension until 18 October 2018 through an Operations Update to enable the IFRC to deliver the replenishment stocks and conduct the lessons learnt workshop.|MDRBI014
937|This brought the overall operational timeframe to five months.|MDRBI014
938|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), AECID, the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRBI014
939|The IFRC, on behalf of the Burundi Red Cross Society, extends its thanks to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRBI014
1046|The rainy season began as usual in October 2014.|MDRBO010
1047|Sixty-two per cent of victims were affected by hail and thunderstorms and 37 percent by the rains.|MDRBO010
1048|Precipitation intensified in the north-eastern areas of the country, especially in northern La Paz, Beni and Pando.|MDRBO010
1049|On April 15, the National Information System (SINAGER) of the VIDECI reported that the emergency left 32 people dead, 6 missing and affected 120 municipalities in 9 departments; a state of emergency was declared in 39 of the municipalities.|MDRBO010
1050|Although nine departments were affected, only two have declared an emergency (La Paz and Chuquisaca) to date.|MDRBO010
1051|According to the Ministry of Rural Development and Lands (MDRT), hail and frost have damaged more than 13,000 hectares of crops.|MDRBO010
1052|The department of Pando located in the Amazon region is the most affected by overflowing rivers, especially the department's capital, Cobija, and other rural municipalities.|MDRBO010
1053|According to VIDECI, a total of 1,392 families, representing 6,960 people were affected, most of whom were evacuated to 25 collective centres that were set up in stadiums and schools.|MDRBO010
1054|A state of emergency has been declared in the municipalities of Filadelphia, Bolpebra, Cobija and Porvenir.|MDRBO010
1055|Humanitarian needs mostly involve food security, clean water and sanitation, housing and protection in the collective centres.|MDRBO010
1056|Educational activities in the capital of Pando have been suspended and health problems are expected to arise.|MDRBO010
1057|Response is being coordinated by all three levels of the government, which have operational support from the armed forces, police and other local institutions.|MDRBO010
1058|During this response period, affected families in Cobija were housed in 24 collective centres.|MDRBO010
1059|According to reports from the departmental, municipal and district Civil Defence emergency operation centres (EOC) a total of 1,022 families (5,000 people) have been provided with shelter .|MDRBO010
1060|Municipal and departmental EOCs were activated and the government responded to the emergency.|MDRBO010
1061|Municipalities have financial resources that have not yet been entirely spent, according to VIDECI.|MDRBO010
1062|The affected people’s needs are currently being covered with resources from the municipalities and the government, which worked together with the Civil Defence on the evacuations.|MDRBO010
1063|As mentioned before, the department of La Paz also suffered from heavy rains; the municipalities in Yungas (Caranavi, Guanay, Mapiri and Tipuani) were particularly impacted.|MDRBO010
1064|The water volume originated in higher areas such as the city of La Paz, which is located 3,600 m above sea level, causing floods and high river flows that strongly affected communities downstream, the municipality of Mecapaca in particular.|MDRBO010
1065|These communities, which depend entirely on agriculture, have had their main source of food and income affected, resulting in a significant reduction in vulnerable families’ capacity to meet basic needs.|MDRBO010
1087|On Epidemiological Week 16 (15-21 April), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) reported an influenza outbreak1 in Bolivia's Santa Cruz department.|MDRBO011
1088|In response, on 8 May, the Ministry of Health (MoH) began a nationwide influenza vaccination campaign mainly targeting at-risk groups such as children between the ages of 6 and 24 months, pregnant women, adults over 60 and people with chronic diseases (hypertension, obesity, immunological issues, etc.) that could lead to complications.|MDRBO011
1089|Coverage of 25 per cent had been achieved by early June.|MDRBO011
1090|By Epidemiological Week 22 (27 May to 2 June), the Santa Cruz Departmental Health Service (SEDES) reported 5,334 suspected cases, 1,428 confirmed cases and 23 deaths.|MDRBO011
1091|Unlike previous years, this outbreak was characterized by a high lethality rate (1.61 per cent) among at-risk population groups, mainly affecting people with underlying chronic diseases.|MDRBO011
1092|According to PAHO and the MoH, the lethality of the outbreak was attributed to two main factors: a) people who died from influenza had not been vaccinated; and b) people delayed seeking medical attention up to three or four days after the onset of symptoms.|MDRBO011
1093|The number of new cases began to decrease by Epidemiological Week 26 (24-30 June), a trend that continued during the following epidemiological weeks.|MDRBO011
1094|By 30 July, the incidence of cases fell below the alert threshold for the influenza endemic channel.|MDRBO011
1095|The following table provides information on the annual history of influenza cases between 2009 and 2018:|MDRBO011
1096|By Epidemiological Week 36 (2-8 September), there were 1,489 confirmed cases of influenza and 31 deaths.|MDRBO011
1123|In mid-2015, heavy rains fell in southern Brazil, affecting 283,140 people mainly in the States of Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande Du Sul.|MDRBR007
1124|The latter was the most affected, as Gravataí, Arrollo Sapucaya and Uruguay rivers exceeded normal levels, affecting 158,793 people.|MDRBR007
1125|Due to the recurrence of rains and hail in the area, a State of Emergency was declared on 14 July at the municipal level, and on 1 October it was extended for three more months in 34 affected municipalities.|MDRBR007
1126|The Brazilian state body Civil Defence responded to the emergency with support from response agencies, monitoring the status of the Uruguay, Cai and Sinos Rivers and providing all necessary assistance to security forces in municipalities.|MDRBR007
1127|This DREF operation was extended for one month due to continuing rains and the level of impact to the population.|MDRBR007
1128|The following table lists the number of people affected by this emergency and the numbers in temporary collective centres by State:|MDRBR007
1164|Brazil reported an outbreak of yellow fever, a mosquitoborne viral infection, in December 2016.|MDRBR008
1165|The outbreak predominantly affected the south-eastern states of Brazil, especially Minas Gerais and Espiritu Santo, and it was the largest outbreak of the disease in decades.|MDRBR008
1166|On 13 January, the Ministry of Health declared a public health emergency in the state of Minas Gerais.|MDRBR008
1167|The largest number of new yellow fever cases occurred from January to early April 2017 (rainy season in southeast Brazil), mainly affecting municipalities in the states of Minas Gerais (1,147 reported cases, 446 confirmed cases and 159 deaths) and Espírito Santo (815 reported cases, 294 confirmed cases and 90 deaths).|MDRBR008
1168|The incidence rate started to decrease in May 2017; however, the epidemic outbreak entered a new stage of geographical dispersion as it spread to municipalities in the States of Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and Espiritu Santo.|MDRBR008
1169|According to the Ministry of Health's epidemiological report for yellow fever (no. 48 for July 2017), 3,564 completed reports were submitted, of which 777 cases were confirmed.|MDRBR008
1170|A total of 261 people died from yellow fever, resulting in a fatality rate for confirmed cases of 33.5 percent.|MDRBR008
1171|More than 98 per cent of confirmed cases were found in the southeastern states, and the most affected states in terms of number of confirmed cases were Minas Gerais (465), Espiritu Santo (467), Rio de Janeiro (23) and Sao Paulo (22).1 No new cases were reported after June 2017 due heavy rainfall, which destroyed mosquito-breeding sites.|MDRBR008
1172|However, the vigilance around vector control remained high to prevent future outbreaks.|MDRBR008
1173|On 6 September 2017, Brazil’s Ministry of Health declared an end to the yellow fever outbreak.|MDRBR008
1253|Between 18 and 23 February 2017, Botswana was hit by the tropical depression, ex-Dineo, which caused significant flooding across the country.|MDRBW003
1254|Bridges collapsed, roads were closed, and some schools were closed as students could not access them.|MDRBW003
1255|Some hospitals were also flooded.|MDRBW003
1256|Gaborone Dam, the main water source in the capital city, was at high risk of overflowing, which posed a risk to those residing in flood plains adjacent to the river.|MDRBW003
1257|The Department of Water Affairs indicated that water levels from rivers and dams had increased significantly.|MDRBW003
1258|To exacerbate the impact of the depression, ex-Dineo hit Botswana at the height of the rainy season, which had already over-saturated the ground and raised the likelihood of significant overland flooding.|MDRBW003
1259|Throughout the 2016/17 rainy season, Botswana recorded precipitation levels ranging between 110mm and 220mm.|MDRBW003
1260|According to National Disaster Management Office (NDMO), by the end of February, some 650 households had been severely affected by flooding as a result of ex-Dineo.|MDRBW003
1261|Over 500 houses were destroyed and infrastructure, telecommunication lines and livelihoods were disrupted in the affected districts.|MDRBW003
1262|The situation resulted in moderate population displacement, which required the hosting of some 300 households in community halls, schools and churches.|MDRBW003
1263|Water sources were also affected, which posed a further threat to the displaced.|MDRBW003
1264|Destroyed latrines, stagnant water, and contaminated boreholes heightened the health risks as well as the exposure to waterborne and communicable diseases.|MDRBW003
1265|The National Society conducted a detailed assessment of the situation in the affected communities and noted that the affected communities would not recover quickly from the impacts of the floods due to the magnitude of the destruction especially with regards to shelter.|MDRBW003
1266|The assessment also indicated that most of the affected victims were mainly lowincome households which also affected their ability to recover quickly.|MDRBW003
1267|The BRCS launched a DREF worth CHF 82,958 in March 2017 with the main objective of providing immediate relief assistance to 1,025 people (205 households) focusing on shelter, health, water, and sanitation and hygiene promotion.|MDRBW003
1290|On 23 February 2018, above normal rainfall fell in Tutume Sub district in Central Botswana.|MDRBW004
1291|The rainy season, which ended in March 2018 destroyed many households and roads.|MDRBW004
1292|The drastic weather change resulted in torrential rains that affected the district causing displacement, damage to property and a risk of an outbreak of water borne and vector related disease.|MDRBW004
1293|According to the Department of Meteorology Services, rainfall amounts range between 120-192mm, with a report of dams over flowing, causing floods in the neighbouring villages of the Tutume sub district.|MDRBW004
1294|The water in the affected villages have dried up, but the destruction of roads and houses are still visible.|MDRBW004
1295|The water in the outer villages, along the road is still visible at the time of this report.|MDRBW004
1296|From preliminary local authority assessments, images shared online, newspapers and by RC volunteers’ observations on the ground, the most affected villages were in the Tutume sub district, comprising of the following: Gweta, Zoroga and Tsookotshaa.|MDRBW004
1297|As of the 26th February, the villages of Gweta, Zoroga and Tsookotshaa were reported to be entirely flooded, affecting approximately 845 households (4,225 people).|MDRBW004
1298|On 27 February 2018, the affected households were being evacuated to Gweta Vocational Training Centre and Zoroga Primary school.|MDRBW004
1299|Gweta, Zoroga and Tsookotshaa villages were the most affected area which left household damaged thus leaving most people with no place to stay.|MDRBW004
1300|The rain also had caused destruction to water sewages at the hospitals.|MDRBW004
1301|The spillage from the hospital sewerage was handled very well by the district authorities as they prevented contamination of water sources from both villages.|MDRBW004
1302|The BRCS continued with information dissemination to sensitise the community members to be very careful in handling and use of water, as it was not confirmed whether the water was safe or not during the assessment period.|MDRBW004
1303|Water purification tables were distributed at household level and volunteers demonstrated how the water is treated using the aqua tablets.|MDRBW004
1304|During the distribution of relief items, the water had dried up, which helped implementation to go smoothly despite internal roads being damaged by flooding.|MDRBW004
1305|During the implementation phase, the affected people who were residing at the evacuation sites were to move back to the affected villages to start rebuilding their collapsed and destroyed houses, with the assistance from Red Cross volunteers and District Commissioner`s office.|MDRBW004
1306|The government had setup temporary shelters for a period of 3 months (according to the emergency government policy) targeting households who had lost their homes.|MDRBW004
1307|The temporary shelters from the Government had to be returned.|MDRBW004
1308|People who received assistance from Botswana Red Cross were also assessed by the local authority to take into consideration other vulnerabilities and further follow up.|MDRBW004
1309|The community leaders and members were engaged from the beginning of the operation in order to support and clarify the beneficiaries’ selection process and explain the distribution (items and process).|MDRBW004
1310|This community engagement was ensured by BRCS and the local authorities.|MDRBW004
1311|The Botswana Red Cross Society (BRCS) received several requests for relief intervention from District Authorities Offices, but the Country had not declared the situation as a national emergency.|MDRBW004
1312|Although the Government did not declare these floods as a national emergency, there were important humanitarian needs such as shelter and WASH, which the National Society was unable to respond to without support.|MDRBW004
1313|Therefore, the NS requested a CHF 111,493 DREF grant from the IFRC.|MDRBW004
1314|The National Society, through this DREF operation, provided assistance to 564 most affected households in the three severely affected villages (322 HH relocated in evacuation centres, 97 HH moved to host families and 145 HH who were still living in their partially flooded homes).|MDRBW004
1315|30 volunteers were trained on WASH, hygiene promotion and shelter support while 53 stakeholders were trained on community engagement and accountability (CEA), including government departments, affected populations and BRCS volunteers.|MDRBW004
1316|The CEA training was a way of creating a platform to evaluate the just ended DREF operation as well as making future recommendation.|MDRBW004
1317|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), AECID, the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRBW004
1318|On behalf of Botswana Red Cross Society, the IFRC would like to extend its gratitude to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRBW004
1382|In the beginning of January 2017, temperatures dropped down to 25-29 degrees Celsius below zero, and in some places even to minus 31-34 degrees.|MDRBY007

1387|Within one night, snow layers reached up to 18-22 cm.|MDRBY007
1388|Snow caused a large number of road accidents, including those with intercity buses, leaving the drivers and travelers stranded for hours on highways.|MDRBY007
1389|In addition, the wind was 19-22 meters per second according to the Belarusian hydro-meteorological centre.|MDRBY007
1390|According to the data reported on 11 January 2017, it is estimated that 539 people (including 31 children) were traumatized and 10 died of hypothermia.|MDRBY007
1391|All six regions of Belarus, Vitebsk, Minsk, Gomel, Grodno, Brest and Mogilev regions and Minsk city have been affected by extreme winter conditions.|MDRBY007
1392|The cyclone has considerably affected the most vulnerable people, in particular those who had to be out in the open air for a long time, the homeless and elderly people in remote areas with disruptions in heating as well as Orthodox believers who attended Christmas Eve mass on 6-7 January.|MDRBY007
1393|10,000 people attended the mass in Minsk, 2,000 in Gomel, 2,000 in Mogilev, 1,000 in Grodno, 1,500 in Vitebsk, and 500 in Brest.|MDRBY007

1395|In the second half of January and February 2017, disaster response teams of the Belarus Red Cross continued to provide support for those affected.|MDRBY007
1396|The disaster response teams also worked intensively with the Ministry of Emergency and with the representatives of the executive authorities.|MDRBY007
1397|In total, BRC assisted 56,413 vulnerable people.|MDRBY007
1398|This number includes 2,554 homeless people, who received hot meals and warm clothes, and 224 stranded drivers.|MDRBY007
1430|On 15 March 2018, a meeting of the Emergency Situations Commission of the Republic of Belarus was held to discuss the coming spring floods in Belarus.|MDRBY008
1431|The meeting was facilitated by the Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of Belarus.|MDRBY008
1432|The Belarus Red Cross (BRC) participated in the meeting, where the leaders of the country asked the BRC to mobilise staff, volunteers and funds to support the affected population.|MDRBY008
1433|The Emergency Situations Commission stated that the analysis of the hydrometeorological conditions has shown that in 43 districts the territory of 140 villages and towns and 36 gardeners’ partnerships will suffer from flooding.|MDRBY008
1434|Moreover, some elements of transport infrastructure (70 road segments and 15 bridges) and houses (including 6,608 garden cottages) can be affected.|MDRBY008
1435|On 19 March, floods were reported by the Belarusian authorities, local media and Belarus Red Cross branches, with 316 houses reported to be flooded in three regions of the country.|MDRBY008
1436|According to information provided by hydro-meteorological agencies, rapidly-increasing volumes of water were observed across the entire country.|MDRBY008
1437|The rise of water levels amounted to 10–200 cm per day, depending on the district.|MDRBY008
1438|The water level of rivers was rising, with ice still covering the rivers Western Dvina, Dniepr, Berezina, Sozh, as well as the Vileiskoe, Chigirinskoe, Zaslavskoe, Soligorskoe, Krasnaya Sloboda water storages, and the lakes Drivyaty, Naroch, Chervonoe.|MDRBY008
1439|With the melting of ice, significant increases of water levels were expected.|MDRBY008
1440|Snow was still on the ground in some districts, reaching up to 20 cm.|MDRBY008
1441|On 21 March, it snowed, which further worsened the situation with thawing.|MDRBY008
1442|The daily water-level fluctuation in the rivers was on average 12 cm.|MDRBY008
1443|In many rivers, the level of water was above bottom land.|MDRBY008
1444|Rivers Pripyat, Sluch and Ubort reached critical water levels by mid-April.|MDRBY008
1445|The most critical areas were the ones near village Chernichi, in Gomel region.|MDRBY008
1446|1,356 houses were fully or partially flooded by mid-April.|MDRBY008
1447|As of 19 April, there were severe floods in 14 districts of the Republic of Belarus – with the total population of the affected districts being around 400,000 people.|MDRBY008
1448|Roads were damaged, which made it difficult to deliver aid.|MDRBY008
1449|The increase of water level continued on Berezina and Sozh rivers, as well as Dnepr river near Zhlobin and Loev cities with a daily increase of 1-10 cm per day.|MDRBY008
1450|There were water level fluctuations in Western Dvina, Neman and Pripyat rivers, with an intensity of 124 cm per day.|MDRBY008

1455|Since 10 May, the floods on the territory of Belarus have been actively decreasing, and the affected population started to complete recovery works.|MDRBY008
1471|On 18 October 2015, an area of low pressure moved away from Belize, causing the onset of heavy rainfall that had begun on 15 October and continued across the country, Belize City in particular, where residents were affected by localized flooding.|MDRBZ004
1472|This system continued to produce heavy rainfall across coastal, northern and western Belize throughout the night and into 19 October 2015, causing severe flooding in much of Belize City and various other areas of the country.|MDRBZ004
1473|CEMO evacuated people living in low-lying and extremely vulnerable areas to four different collective centres in the city and a few more in the northern district of Corozal while residents along rivers, creeks, waterways and low-lying areas whose homes were likely to flood, were cautioned to move to high ground or to community collective centres.|MDRBZ004
1474|Farmers were forced to make the necessary preparations for their livestock and crops.|MDRBZ004
1475|During this time, compounded by heavy rains in both Guatemala and Mexico, Belize received a total of 71 cm of rain over a five-day period.|MDRBZ004
1476|Official government assessments were never disclosed or shared with the BRCS, and access to some of the affected communities was difficult due to fallen live electrical lines lying in flooded yards in some communities in Belize City.|MDRBZ004
1477|It was estimated, that several hundred families were badly affected by this situation.|MDRBZ004
1478|After a day and a half of assisting CEMO with their response and not receiving any information on the assessments that were being carried out, the Belize Red Cross Society determined it was necessary to branch off on its own in order to carry out their own assessments in affected areas in Belize City.|MDRBZ004
1479|According to the plan of action, the aim was to assist 350 families (approximately 1,750 people), 150 families in Corozal and 200 in Belize City.|MDRBZ004
1480|The distribution of relief was in the form of blankets, tarpaulins, hygiene kits, buckets, drinking water, cleaning kits, jerry cans and clothing from 18 October to 1 April 2016.|MDRBZ004
1499|Hurricane Earl made landfall on 4 August 2016, with wind gusts of up to 110 km/h, as estimated by the United States’ National Hurricane Centre.|MDRBZ005
1500|NEMO reported major infrastructural and building damage, forcing 170 people to seek shelter in collective centres in Belize City, Cayo and Orange Walk.|MDRBZ005
1501|In total, 10,355 people (2,071 families) were affected after Hurricane Earl ripped through Belize as a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Wind scale.|MDRBZ005
1502|Belize City and Ladyville were the most affected areas; NEMO assigned these areas (periurban areas) to the National Society, which conducted detailed assessments following the disaster.|MDRBZ005
1503|Meanwhile, the government provided immediate relief to the affected people and communities.|MDRBZ005
1504|The Belize Red Cross Society conducted field assessments with Open Data Kit (ODK) of 1,267 households, through which the following data was obtained:|MDRBZ005
1546|Intensive rains in the DRC, starting from mid-November 2015, caused flooding across the country.|MDRCD016
1547|As of 6 December 2015, these torrential rains caused the overflowing of the Ndjili and Congo Rivers, causing flooding in the municipalities of Limeté (in Kingabua Ndanu and Kingabua Pecheur neighbourhoods) and Matete (Debonhome and Salongo neighbourhoods) in Kinshasa.|MDRCD016
1548|Some 10,560 people were affected (2,112 families), while 31 deaths and several injuries were recorded.|MDRCD016
1549|An estimated 1,696 families (8,480 people) were displaced, having lost their homes and property following the floods.|MDRCD016
1550|They were thus obliged to live in proximity within host families in neighbourhoods around the affected areas.|MDRCD016
1551|Amongst the destructions caused by the floods, was the damage of the water treatment centre of the Water Distribution Authority located on the banks of the N'djili River, which supplies water to the city, resulting in lack of drinking water for the population.|MDRCD016
1552|Although the floods receded in some neighbourhoods of Matete (Debonhomme and Salongo), part of Limeté neighbourhoods (Kingabua Pecheur and Kingabua Ndanu) remained under water, making the people in these areas turn to the use of canoes for movement.|MDRCD016
1553|Other municipalities of Kinshasa, including Mont Ngafula, Ngaliema and Masina were also affected and the evaluation conducted in Mont Ngafula provided key information (contained in Table 2 below), which led to the extension of the operation and expansion of activities to the Kindele, Kimbondo, Masanga-Mbila and Ngansele neighbourhoods of Mont Ngafula, to assist an additional 2,615 people (375 families).|MDRCD016
1554|The floods were also reported in other provinces as seen in the following Table:|MDRCD016
1555|After the launching of the operation, the Red Cross of DRC conducted a detailed assessment of the situation, which led to the revision of the EPoA and timeframe (see Operations Update No 1).|MDRCD016
1556|Operations update No 2 further extended the timeframe of the operation to enable an operational review and a finance analyst mission to support closure of the operation (see Operations Update No 2).|MDRCD016
1557|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID) the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRCD016
1558|The IFRC, on behalf of the Red Cross Society of DRC would like to extend many thanks to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRCD016
1569|In January 2016, a yellow fever outbreak was detected and confirmed in Angola, Southern Africa.|MDRCD017
1570|Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes.|MDRCD017
1571|There are an estimated 130,000 cases of yellow fever reported yearly, causing 44,000 deaths worldwide each year, with 90 percent occurring in Africa.|MDRCD017
1572|Following cross-border population movement from Angola into neighbouring countries, exported cases were reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).|MDRCD017
1573|On 23 March 2016, the DRC Ministry of Health (MoH) declared an official yellow fever outbreak, with a total of 39 imported cases from Angola reported in Kongo Central and Kinshasa provinces.|MDRCD017
1574|According to the World Health Organization (WHO), some autochthonous transmission cases had been also reported in Ndjili, Kinshasa and in Matadi, Kongo Central province.|MDRCD017
1575|As of 11 May 2016, a total of 44 yellow fever cases were confirmed with 551 suspected cases reported including 167 in Kongo Central and 133 in Kinshasa.|MDRCD017
1576|Given the risk of spread to other areas of the DRC as well as to other neighbouring African countries, the MoH of DRC with the support of the international community decided to undertake an emergency vaccination campaign targeting 1.9 million people in the most at-risk regions.|MDRCD017
1577|Vaccination is the most important preventive measure against yellow fever.|MDRCD017
1578|On 20 May 2016, the IFRC allocated a total of CHF 177,927 from its Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to contribute to the response to the yellow fever epidemic in the DRC.|MDRCD017
1579|This DREF allocation was to support the DRC Red Cross and the Ministry of Health conduct social mobilization during the vaccination campaign against yellow fever, from 26 May 4 June in two health zones in the province of Kinshasa and nine health zones of the province of Kongo Central.|MDRCD017
1580|On 18 July, the operation was extended for one addition month, to allow for a Knowledge Attitude and Practice (KAP) survey and lessons learned workshop of this DREF operation to be undertaken.|MDRCD017
1581|These activities have now concluded.|MDRCD017
1582|Despite this DREF operation, the number of Yellow Fever cases continued to increase along with cases of measles and cholera.|MDRCD017
1583|In response to these outbreaks, the IFRC in support of DRC Red Cross launched an Emergency Appeal for the epidemics (MDRCD018).|MDRCD017
1584|This DREF has been replenished by the Netherlands Red Cross/Silent Emergencies Fund, the Belgian Red Cross/Government and the Canadian Red Cross/ Government DFATD and other corporate and private donors.|MDRCD017
1585|The IFRC on behalf on the DRC Red Cross Society would like to express its gratitude to all for their generous contributions.|MDRCD017
1586|A balance of CHF 878 will be returned to the DREF.|MDRCD017
1638|Suspected cases of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) started appearing in Nambwa health centre on 22 April 2017 when a 39-year-old male subject with fever, asthenia, vomiting of blood, bloody diarrhoea, haematuria, epistaxis and extreme fatigue was brought in.|MDRCD020
1639|Upon seeing the seriousness of the case, the health centre decided to refer it to the Reference General Hospital (RGH) of Likati, but the man died 12 km before getting to the RGH.|MDRCD020
1640|A few days later, the driver and the person behind the motorcycle carrying the index case developed the same signs and symptoms.|MDRCD020
1641|The death of the driver was later announced.|MDRCD020
1642|As of 15th May 2017, 19 suspected and 1 confirmed cases had already been declared, with 3 deaths in Nambwa health area alone.|MDRCD020
1643|The suspected cases were spread over 3 health areas, namely Nambwa, Mouma and Ngayi.|MDRCD020
1644|The alert was issued at national level on 8 May 2017 by the Provincial Health Division, 17 days after the death of the index case (who probably became ill between weeks 14 and 15 of 2017).|MDRCD020
1645|Following the issuance of the national alert, IFRC supported the DRC RC in launching a DREF Emergency Plan of Action (EPoA) on 15th May 2017 to help respond to the epidemic outbreak.|MDRCD020
1646|The EPoA was initially seeking CHF 199,110 to assist 5,831 people for 3 months.|MDRCD020
1647|Based on the data collected during the first 2 weeks of implementation of the EPoA, the National Society (NS) submitted the DREF operation update No 1, which was issued on 2 June 2017 to widen the scope of intervention and reach an additional 12,831 people, bringing the overall number of targeted persons to 18 662 people.|MDRCD020
1648|That update also revised DREF budget from CHF 199,110 to CHF 381,022 (supplementary allocation of CHF 181,912), and extended operation timeframe from 3 months to 4 months, to allow enough time for the NS to reach the maximum number of targeted people.|MDRCD020
1649|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), AECID, the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRCD020
1650|The IFRC, on behalf of the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), extends its thanks to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRCD020
1663|On 13 May 2017, people fleeing conflicts in neighbouring Central African Republic, precisely in Bangassou, started arriving in the Yakoma, Mobayi Mbongo and Gbadolite localities of North Ubangi province, as well as in the Bondo Territory of Bas Uélé province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).|MDRCD021
1664|A rapid assessment conducted by DRC RC indicated that there were 8 478 CAR refugees in Yakoma, Mobayi Bongo and Gbadolite, and another 8 720 CAR refugees in the Bondo territory of Bas Uélé province.|MDRCD021
1665|Thus, the total number of CAR refugees registered in the 2 provinces was 17 198 (3 440 households).|MDRCD021
1666|The refugees, amongst whom were injured persons, pregnant women, as well as separated and unaccompanied children, arrived with little personal belongings and were all living under critical conditions.|MDRCD021
1667|They presented urgent needs in the areas of Health, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene promotion (WASH), Shelter and non-food items (NFI) distribution.|MDRCD021
1668|A first DREF allocation of CHF 166,967 was granted on 06 June 2017 to enable the DRC RC to respond to the most urgent needs of the CAR refugees, while conducting an in-depth assessment of the situation with the view of planning a comprehensive response operation.|MDRCD021
1669|By then, the National Society (NS) believed there were 5% of the 17 198 CAR refugees, i.e. 860 refugees or 172 families in need of immediate assistance.|MDRCD021
1670|The in-depth assessment conducted by the NS one month into the operation indicated that there were much more urgent needs than anticipated.|MDRCD021
1671|As such, Operations update No 1, which was published on 8 August 2017, increased the number of people to be assisted from 860 people (172 families) to 5,605 CAR refugees or 1,121 families, and the budget was revised and increased from CHF 166,967 to CHF 475,166.|MDRCD021
1672|Operations update No 1 also extended the timeframe from the initial 2 months to 5 months, with a new end date of 14 November 2017.|MDRCD021
1673|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), AECID, the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRCD021
1674|The IFRC, on behalf of the DRC Red Cross, would like to extend many thanks to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRCD021
1699|Tensions between traditional leaders and Government authorities began in Kasai Central in August 2016.|MDRCD022
1700|The situation deteriorated almost daily, resulting into an open conflict in early 2017.|MDRCD022
1701|The uncontrolled exactions led to the killings of many people and the displacement of about 1.4 million people in the provinces surrounding Kasai Central as of 31st March 2017.|MDRCD022
1702|Due to the complexity of the situation, it was not possible for the host National Society (HNS) to have all the details required to plan a comprehensive response to the humanitarian crisis.|MDRCD022
1703|Nevertheless, the then available information was used to launch this DREF operation (set for two months), with the firm commitment to conduct a detailed assessment of the situation and come out with a more holistic response plan of action, targeting Kwilu, Lomami and Sankuru provinces.|MDRCD022
1704|Moreover, the DREF operation initially targeted the most vulnerable 612 families (3,060 people) to be reached with WASH and health activities, as well as the distribution of non-food items (NFIs).|MDRCD022
1705|As the HNS, IFRC and partner National Societies (PNSs) were preparing to launch the planned detailed multisector needs assessment, they realized that the initial budget will not be enough to cover the assessment.|MDRCD022
1706|Thus, Operations update No 1 was published on 10th October 2017 to increase the DREF budget with a second allocation of CHF 17,738, thereby bringing the total DREF budget from CHF 253,588 to CHF 271,326.|MDRCD022
1707|That update also extended the timeframe for an additional 1 month, until 17 November 2017.|MDRCD022
1708|In keeping with the objective of developing a detailed plan of action following the detailed needs assessment, the team started preparing a new emergency plan of action (EPoA) but had to request a no-cost timeframe extension as they could not complete within the set timeframe of 3 months.|MDRCD022
1709|Thus, Operations Update No 2 was published on 4th December 2018 to extend the operation timeframe until 18 December 2017, making the total DREF timeframe to be 4 months as compared to the initial 2 months.|MDRCD022
1710|All planned activities under this operation were carried out, and a new EPoA was developed and submitted as a separate operation (Emergency Appeal) launched on 10 January 2018.|MDRCD022
1711|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), AECID, the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRCD022
1712|The IFRC, on behalf of the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), extends its thanks to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRCD022
1724|Heavy rains occurred in Kinshasa in early January 2018, resulting in flooding, landslide and silting in nine (9) communes of the Kinshasa province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).|MDRCD024
1725|The nine communes included Galiema, Bandalungwa, Selembao, Masina, Limete, Kalamu, Bumbu, Kimbaseke and Ndjili.|MDRCD024
1726|At the same time, a cholera outbreak was declared in Kinshasa, with the epicenter in Galiema, one of the flooded communes.|MDRCD024
1727|Thus, a DREF operation was launched with an allocation of CHF 340,944 granted on 19 January 2018 to help the DRC Red Cross respond to floods and also carry out cholera response and prevention activities in Kinshasa.|MDRCD024
1728|During the first two months of the operation, 14 new cases of cholera were notified in six new communes of Kinshasa, namely Maluku II, Kokolo, Nsele, Kasavubu, Kinshasa (Kisoke 40 street) and Kinsenso, with at least one cholera case notified in each of these communes.|MDRCD024
1729|Following this development, Operations update No 1 was published on 10 April 2018 to request for a supplementary DREF allocation of CHF 47,662 to expand the cholera response and prevention activities to the newly affected communes, thereby bringing the total DREF allocation for this operation to CHF 388,606.|MDRCD024
1730|Operation update No 1 also increased the number of people targeted to include the entire population living in the newly affected 6 communes, i.e. approximately 1,939,843 people; and allowed for a one-month extension to enable the National Society (NS) to implement newly planned activities.|MDRCD024
1731|This final report therefore highlights the achievements and lessons learned throughout the 4-month timeframe of the operation.|MDRCD024
1799|On 24 April 2015, continuous storms resulted in extensive flooding, destroying houses and resulting in the loss of household belongings in the first, second, third, fourth and fifth districts of Berberati, located 584 kilometres from Bangui in the Central African Republic (CAR).|MDRCF019
1800|According to a rapid assessment carried out by the local committee of the Central African Republic Red Cross (CARC), 210 households (1,109 people) were affected, with 199 houses completed destroyed.|MDRCF019
1801|It was reported that one person died and 7 others were injured and transferred to the Berberati regional hospital for treatment.|MDRCF019
1802|As of 5 May 2015 the displaced population was being hosted by locals in Berberati while others lived in the open air, exposing them to extreme weather conditions, as well as the risk of contracting communicable and respiratory diseases.|MDRCF019
1803|In addition, water and sanitation infrastructures were submerged and contaminated, increasing the risk for waterborne diseases to spread.|MDRCF019
1804|It should be noted that the displaced population were already extremely vulnerable prior to the floods since they were also affected by the CAR socio-political crisis and still suffering its consequences.|MDRCF019
1805|On 14 May 2015, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) released 99,788 Swiss franc from the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to support CARC respond to the emergency relief, shelter, health and care needs of the affected population, for a period of 3 months.|MDRCF019
1806|On 12 August 2015, an Operations Update was issued, which extended the timeframe of the DREF operation by 2 weeks (New end date: 31 August 2015) to enable the completion of the activities planned in the Emergency Plan of Action (EPoA), specifically a beneficiary satisfaction survey and complete the payment of per diems due to the volunteers.|MDRCF019
1807|The major donors and partners of the DREF included the Red Cross Societies and Governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID) the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRCF019
1808|The IFRC, on behalf of the Central African Red Cross would like to extend many thanks to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRCF019
1843|On 4 December 2015, two children aged 9 and 5 were found suffering from an unidentified disease with rashes all over their bodies in Lengo village, located at some 15 kilometres from Bakouma in the Mbomou province, eastern Central African Republic (CAR), and taken to the Bakouma Health Centre.|MDRCF020
1844|On 10 December 2015, in response to the outbreak in Bangassou, WHO facilitated an initial assessment carried out by the Ministry of Health (MoH) in the affected province and a joint mission was undertaken by the health district and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) Belgium.|MDRCF020
1845|On 17 December 2015, the children were transferred to the Bangassou Regional Hospital, run by an international non-governmental organization (NGO) and MSF, where their condition got worse.|MDRCF020
1846|Samples were taken and sent to the Pasteur Institute of Bangui for laboratory testing.|MDRCF020
1847|Upon announcement of the outbreak of monkey pox by WHO on 13 January 2016, the CARC and IFRC continued to take part in the crisis meeting co-led by the MoH and WHO on the strategic response plan for this outbreak.|MDRCF020
1848|As part of the initial response, the CARC, with support from UNICEF provided the following materials at the request of the MoH:|MDRCF020
1849|In addition, the Bangassou Red Cross local Committee was part of the provincial response crisis taskforce put in place by the provincial authorities.|MDRCF020
1850|The MoH requested the CARC, with the support of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), to carry out social mobilisation, communication and epidemiological surveillance activities.|MDRCF020
1851|This DREF was replenished by the Canadian Red Cross Society/Government and Netherlands Red Cross/Silent Emergencies Fund.|MDRCF020
1852|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID) the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRCF020
1853|The IFRC, on behalf of the Central African Red Cross would like to extend its thanks to all partners for their generous contributions to this DREF operation.|MDRCF020
1862|From August to December 2016, the Central African Republic (CAR) faced a serious cholera epidemic outbreak which caused damage and death among the CAR population.|MDRCF021
1863|According to the Ministry of Health (MoH) and WHO situational report dated on 7 August 2016, from 27 July to 5 August 2016, at least 36 cases of acute watery diarrhea with severe dehydration were reported in villages along River Ubangi.|MDRCF021
1864|In addition, eight (8) deaths were also reported in Mourou-fleuve village, in the Ndjoukou district, Kemo Province.|MDRCF021
1865|A further nine (9) cases of acute watery diarrhea with severe dehydration, including five deaths, were recorded between 5 and 10 August 2016 at Zawara, Danga and Massamba villages in the Damara district and one case at the Bruxelles neighborhood in Bangui.|MDRCF021
1866|On 10 August, the Pasteur Institute of Bangui confirmed the presence of Vibrio Cholerae in the sample taken from the affected cases that originated from Zawara village.|MDRCF021
1867|On the same day, the MoH, during a press conference, declared a state of emergency for cholera epidemic outbreak in the CAR.|MDRCF021
1868|The risk of spread of cholera was very high and the situation was likely going to worsen if this was not addressed in a timely manner. due to the high mobility of the population as well as the rainy season which lasts into November.|MDRCF021
1869|According to the MoH and WHO, the cholera epidemic outbreak reached the capital, Bangui, on the 1st September 2016, with at least four (4) positive cases in the second and third districts; especially in the Benzvi and Boeing neighborhoods of the city.|MDRCF021
1870|The most affected areas remained the 1st, 4th, and the 7th health province of the country.|MDRCF021
1871|According to CAR health cluster report of 20 September 2016, from 5 July to 20 September 2016, some 266 affected cases were registered with 21 deaths (lethality rate: 7.8%).|MDRCF021
1872|Later, the CAR health cluster meeting, held on the 8 November 2016, revealed that the laboratory results of the sample taken on the 266th suspected case were found negative to the vibrio cholera.|MDRCF021
1873|This case was therefore removed from the linear list, thus reducing the number of registered cases to 265 cholera cases including 139 children under 15 years old, with some 20 deaths (lethality rate: 7.5%).|MDRCF021
1874|In addition, eight cases of infection to vibrio cholera and one case of serotype Inaba were confirmed by the Pasteur Institute of Bangui.|MDRCF021
1875|The last confirmed case was registered in Bangui on the 23 September 2016.|MDRCF021
1876|The Minister of Health, in a Press conference held on 4 January 2017, officially declared the end of the cholera epidemic in the country while advising the population to be vigilant.|MDRCF021
1877|While the situation experienced a drop in the number of affected cases as of 2 October 2016, the MoH requested its humanitarian partners to continue with the implementation of prevention activities.|MDRCF021
1878|These activities include social mobilization, communication and community-based awareness on the knowledge of the disease, the risk factors, the universal prevention measures, community-based epidemiological surveillance and hand washing techniques.|MDRCF021
1879|Furthermore, the MoH requested the support of WHO to strengthen the capacity of health facilities in terms of care and management of positive cases, pre-positioning of treatment kits, as well as medicine for the treatment of water-borne diseases, especially in at-risk areas.|MDRCF021
1880|According to the MoH, there was a need to strengthen the national contingency plan for future responses.|MDRCF021
1881|The implementation of activities within this DREF was affected by three major security incidents which did not allow the volunteers to complete planned activities on time.|MDRCF021
1882|All the incidences took place in Bangui, during the implementation period; this resulted in delaying implementation.|MDRCF021
1883|The first incident took place on 2 October 2016, when a commander of the Central African Armed Forces (FACA) was shot dead in his vehicle.|MDRCF021
1884|This incident caused a wave of violence in Bangui City, with shooting near the headquarters of the Central African Red Cross.|MDRCF021
1885|The ensuing violence resulted in the deaths of several people.|MDRCF021
1886|During this period, the entire staff of the Central African Red Cross evacuated their office for a whole week.|MDRCF021
1887|On the ground, door to door activities were suspended throughout that same week.|MDRCF021
1888|On 17 October 2016, while humanitarian activities were resuming timidly, a civil society leader organized a protest demonstration calling for the departure of the country's International Forces (MINUSCA).This event also led to confrontations between demonstrators and international forces.|MDRCF021
1889|This other incident ended in the death of several people.|MDRCF021
1890|For a second time, volunteers were forced to suspend activities.|MDRCF021
1891|Two weeks after this incident, on 31 October 2016, a clash between two armed groups killed the two respective leaders.|MDRCF021
1892|This last incident created heavy gunfire in the city of Bangui.|MDRCF021
1893|Once again, volunteers were obliged to stop their activities.|MDRCF021
1894|This other truce lasted two weeks.|MDRCF021
1895|Insecurity in Bangui resulted in six to eight weeks’ loss of work.|MDRCF021
1896|As such, these events impacted on the implementation of the operation, particularly in Bangui, Begoua and Bimbo as well as on the 10 teams working in these locations.|MDRCF021
1897|In addition, schools were also affected by these different waves of violence.|MDRCF021
1898|Schools officially reopened in September 2016, but given the repetitive violence in the city of Bangui, parents have been reluctant to enroll their children into schools.|MDRCF021
1899|Since then, schools gradually reopened based on the security situation in the area.|MDRCF021
1900|The National Society thus requested an extension period of one month and prioritized the remaining activities to be complete.|MDRCF021
1901|These included community group discussion, awareness raising and the cleaning and disinfection of latrines in schools, distribution of exercise books with covers promoting cholera prevention.|MDRCF021
1910|From January 2017, the Central African Republic (CAR) experienced a series of violent winds in the towns of Kabo, Maka, Bozoum, Bossangoa, Mingala, which received no assistance.|MDRCF022
1911|Soon after, in March 2017, the towns of Mbaïki, Ndolobo, Ndjoh, Lambi and Bossembelé also faced strong winds following torrential rains.|MDRCF022
1912|Indeed, the towns located respectively at 107 km, 125 km and 157 km from Bangui suffered significant damage from these strong winds.|MDRCF022
1913|Some 75 volunteers from the local committees, including 25 from Mbaïki, 15 from Ndolobo, 10 from Lambi, 5 from Ndjoh and 20 from Bossembelé, were deployed to the affected neighbourhoods and started conducting an assessment of the situation while providing first aid to the injured, before evacuating them to the hospital and helping to resettle the most vulnerable in host families.|MDRCF022
1914|They identified and registered the victims who had completely and partially lost their homes and were homeless as summarized in the table below: Initially planned to last for three (3) months, this DREF operation had to be extended by one month for the following reasons: The truck transporting items to be delivered through the DREF operation was blocked at the border for two weeks; The unstable security situation in CAR delayed activities on the field for several days; The transportation of materials was stuck between Mbaïki and Ndolobo because of a collapsed bridge.|MDRCF022
1915|In addition, the implementation team realised that the affected populations had urgent needs in the areas of health; Insalubrity and insufficiency of drinking water affected the population; hygiene promotion activities were a dire need for the communities and the consumption of proper drinking water was still very low in the implementation area.|MDRCF022
1916|All these delays were exacerbated by a succession of public holidays and negatively impacted the implementation schedule of the operation.|MDRCF022
1917|As such, an operations update was published on 12 July 2017, setting the new end date on 30 August 2017.|MDRCF022
1918|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), AECID, the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRCF022
1919|On behalf of the Central African Republic Red Cross (CAR RC), the IFRC would like to extend its gratitude to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRCF022
1934|On 23 August 2017, the town of Kouango, located 415 km away from Bangui (the capital of CAR) experienced heavy rainfall leading to flooding.|MDRCF023
1935|These floods caused serious material and human damage.|MDRCF023
1936|According to the first reports 3,500 people or 700 households were affected by this tragedy and at least 276 houses were completely destroyed, while 74 houses were partially destroyed.|MDRCF023
1937|Some of the affected people found shelter in host families and others were in relief camps.|MDRCF023
1938|Telephone communication network was also disrupted in this locality and according to the National Society, there are no other humanitarian actors on the ground to respond to this disaster.|MDRCF023
1939|The damage assessment revealed the following: Number of households affected: 700 Number of people affected: 3,500 Number of water points damaged: 65 Number of latrines damaged: 76 Number of houses completely destroyed: 276 Number of houses partially destroyed: 74.|MDRCF023
1940|At the time of the disaster, there was a risk of complication of the situation of these affected population and their health conditions because they were exposed to dirty water-related diseases and acute respiratory infections due to bad weather.|MDRCF023
1941|Therefore, this raised problems of emergency shelter, access to drinking water and sanitation in order to avoid a worsening situation of these victims taking into consideration their environment.|MDRCF023
1942|On 01 September 2017, an allocation of CHF 120,337 was granted by the IFRC Disaster relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to support CRCA in providing assistance to some 350 households (1,750 persons) affected by this disaster with the distribution of basic NFIs, emergency health; emergency shelter; water, hygiene and sanitation.|MDRCF023
1943|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), AECID, the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRCF023
1944|On behalf of the Central African Republic Red Cross (CRCA), the IFRC would like to extend its gratitude to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRCF023
2035|In March, 2013, there was an outbreak of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, resulting in about 7,573 deaths of 19,463 cases by 24 December 2015, according to WHO.|MDRCI007
2036|The prevalence of the epidemic affected countries like Mali, Nigeria, Senegal and even the United States of America.|MDRCI007
2037|Given the ease of the spread of the disease across porous borders, strategies aimed at protecting the non-affected countries like Cote d’Ivoire were developed.|MDRCI007
2038|The Red Cross of Côte d’Ivoire undertook preparedness and prevention measures from the beginning of the outbreak in the bordering countries.|MDRCI007
2039|In a continuum of actions, it undertook further EVD preparedness activities, as from April 2015, with the technical and financial support of IFRC.|MDRCI007
2051|On 25 October 2015, Côte d´Ivoire presidential elections was successfully held, despite the 3-days, that took the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) to declare the results.|MDRCI009
2052|Most international organizations including the United Nations (UN) had predicted violence and civil unrest, including this as the most probable scenario in their contingency plans (CP).|MDRCI009
2053|Generally, the elections were conducted in a peaceful manner and this was confirmed by international bodies that monitored the elections, including ONUCI (UN Mission for Côte d´Ivoire).|MDRCI009
2054|The new government was inaugurated On 6 January 2016.|MDRCI009
2055|President Ouattara was re-elected in the first round with more than 86.6 per cent of the votes.|MDRCI009
2056|On 18 October 2015, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) released 34,000 Swiss franc from the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to ensure Côte d'Ivoire Red Cross, (CIRC) was prepared to meet the immediate needs of populations, which were predicted to be affected by election related violence with activities planned for a period of 1 month.|MDRCI009
2057|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and Governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID) the Medtronic and Zurich and other corporate and private donors.|MDRCI009
2058|The IFRC, on behalf of the Croix Rouge Cote d’Ivoire would like to extend its thanks to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRCI009
2196|The Chilean Government declared a state of emergency on 25 March 2015, while the Ministry of Health issued a Health Alert for the communities of Copiapó, Chañaral, Caldera, Tierra Amarilla, Diego de Almagro, Alto del Carmen, Freirina, Huasco, and Vallenar in the Atacama Region.|MDRCL011
2197|In Atacama, 24 people were reported dead, and of 14,525 dwellings registered, 998 were destroyed, 2,736 suffered major damage, and 3,347 suffered minor damage.|MDRCL011
2349|In November 2015, eight hundred and fifty eight (858) cases of measles were reported among the communities in the Far North and North regions of Cameroon, which are under the “control” of the Boko Haram group.|MDRCM022
2350|Of all the recorded cases, the Mokolo district (Mayo-Tsanaga Division) in the Far North region accounted for 587 cases, which for a population of 211,906 people presented an extremely concerning “attack rate”.|MDRCM022
2351|Given the Mokolo health district is located close to the Chad and Nigerian borders, it raised the risk of the epidemic spreading to these countries.|MDRCM022
2352|Cameroon has reported unsatisfactory vaccination coverage against the disease (72 per cent) in accordance with the World Health Organizations (WHO) AFRO “Eliminating Measles in Africa Region by 2020” resolution, and it was therefore proposed that an immediate National measles and rubella (MR) campaign should be initiated to address the epidemic (from 24 – 28 November 2016).|MDRCM022
2353|On 16 November 2015, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) released 61,205 Swiss franc from the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to support the Cameroon Red Cross Society (CRCS) support the Public Ministry of Health (MoH) led vaccination campaign through social mobilization activities targeting 1,609,629 people (95 per cent of children aged 9 months to 14 years) in 30 health districts (Bogo, Bourha, Gazawa, Goulfrey, Guere, Guidiguis, Hina, Kaele, Kar Hay, Kolofata, Kousseri, Koza, Mada, Maga, Makary, Maroua 1, Maroua 2, Maroua 3, Meria, Mindif, Mogode, Mokolo, Mora, Moulvoudaye, Moutourwa, Pette, Roua, Tokombere, Vele and Yagoua) of the Far North region of Cameroon.|MDRCM022
2354|Activities planned included: refresher training/deployment of volunteers to the affected health districts and dissemination of information, education and communication (IEC) materials.|MDRCM022
2355|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID) the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRCM022
2356|The IFRC, on behalf of the Cameroon Red Cross Society would like to extend many thanks to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRCM022
2378|The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) prescribes three strategies to eradicate polio; namely 1) strengthening anti-polio routine immunization; 2) epidemiological surveillance; and 3) supplementary preventive or response immunization activities.|MDRCM023
2379|As part of this initiative, Cameroon has been implementing these 3 strategies, which have enabled the country to remain polio-free from July 2014 to date.|MDRCM023
2380|Two cases of type 1 wild poliovirus (WPV) were confirmed in Borno State in neighbouring Nigeria on 11 August 2016.|MDRCM023
2381|Nigeria registered a third case of wild poliovirus on 5 September 2016 also in Borno State, leading to fears that the disease will reappear in this region affected by insecurity.|MDRCM023
2382|This virus had been circulating in northern Nigeria for more than 5 years without being detected.|MDRCM023
2383|Polio resurgence in this area, a part of the greater Lake Chad Basin, poses a big threat to the polio end game eradication strategy.|MDRCM023
2384|Cameroon shares a long border with Nigeria, and there is intensive population movement of between the two countries along the borders.|MDRCM023
2385|Nigerian nomadic populations and about 72,000 Nigerian refugees fleeing conflict are present in the Far North Region of Cameroon.|MDRCM023
2386|Most of them come from Borno State where the polio outbreak was registered.|MDRCM023
2387|Those 3 cases of WPV were confirmed at a time when the risk of a polio outbreak was increasing progressively in Cameroon due to insufficient collective immunization of children against poliomyelitis, particularly in remote places such as islands, or places affected by the current insecurity caused by conflict.|MDRCM023
2388|The WHO and other observers thus declared that there was a very high risk for the poliovirus to be brought from Nigeria into Cameroon.|MDRCM023
2389|There was also a high possibility to detect an indigenous case that might have been circulating unnoticed since 2014.|MDRCM023
2390|Indeed, since then, epidemiological surveillance, particularly in the Far North Region of Cameroon, had never been completed.|MDRCM023
2391|As such, the Cameroon Government decided to launch a series of 5 preventive immunization campaigns scheduled as follows:|MDRCM023
2392|1. From 26 to 28 August 2016 (already done)|MDRCM023
2393|2. From 17 to 19 September 2016 (already done)|MDRCM023
2394|3. From 8 to 10 October 2016|MDRCM023
2395|4. From 12 to 15 November 2016|MDRCM023
2396|5. From 03 to 05 December 2016|MDRCM023
2397|The first 2 campaigns had been conducted before the start of this operation, but the government requested the Cameroon Red Cross to provide additional support to assist in the remaining three campaigns with support from this DREF allocation.|MDRCM023
2409|On 21 October 2016, a bridge collapsed in Manyaï, a village located some 68 km from Yaoundé, the capital city of Cameroon, disrupting traffic between Yaoundé and Douala.|MDRCM024
2410|The highway Yaoundé-Douala is a very busy road connecting the Douala seaport in Cameroon to other countries of the Central Africa sub-region.|MDRCM024
2411|After the highway became inaccessible in the early hours of Friday 21 October 2016, travellers in Yaoundé and Douala chose to use the only train operator in Cameroon, CAMRAIL, as their only affordable means of transport.|MDRCM024
2412|In response to an unprecedented number of travellers, CAMRAIL authorities decided to add additional wagons to the trains in Douala and Yaoundé, thereby doubling the usual capacity; as reported by the Cameroon Minister of Transports on CRTV, the national television channel.|MDRCM024
2413|The overloaded train (approximately 1,300 passengers on board a train that usually carries 600) left Yaoundé at 11 am bound for Douala, and derailed at Eseka train station, some 119 km from Yaoundé.|MDRCM024
2414|Government sources declared that some 75 people were killed, and approximately 600 wounded, some seriously.|MDRCM024
2415|The accident occurred around midday, a business peak time in such places, as local vendors usually sell goods along the platform.|MDRCM024
2416|To cope with the emergency, at least 20,000 sachets of blood were needed and the National Order of Physicians appealed for contributions from the public, as they could not afford to pay for blood.|MDRCM024
2417|Dead bodies were transported to the hospitals in Yaoundé, and many of them were yet to be identified even 10 days after the accident.|MDRCM024
2418|Indeed, some bodies were very difficult to identify due to the nature of the accident and recovery of bodies was hampered by ongoing rains.|MDRCM024
2436|On 4 August 2017, torrential rains caused floods and mudslides in Santchou, a district located in the Menoua Division of the West region of Cameroon.|MDRCM025
2437|The disaster affected 12,890 people in different ways across the villages in Santchou, with some vulnerable people left homeless, others with houses partially destroyed, and farms and schools destroyed, as well as many houses and public buildings, including schools, flooded.|MDRCM025
2438|The rains continued until October, thereby delaying implementation of the response operation.|MDRCM025
2439|Nevertheless, devoted Cameroon Red Cross volunteers managed to complete all the activities planned despite the adverse weather conditions, preventing a revision of the operation, or an extension of the operation timeframe.|MDRCM025
2440|The National Society (NS) conducted a detailed assessment of the situation as part of this operation, but the findings did not show considerable gaps between the rapid assessment and the detailed assessment.|MDRCM025
2441|Thus, the operational team decided to keep with the response initially planned.|MDRCM025

2607|The Ituango Hydroelectric Project (under construction) is located on the Cauca River in north-western Antioquia department, 170 km from the city of Medellín.|MDRCO015
2608|The dam's main construction work covers parts of the municipalities of Ituango and Briceño; however, its area of influence extends even further towards the municipalities of Santa Fe de Antioquia, Buriticá, Peque, Liborina, Sabanalarga, Toledo, Olaya, San Andrés de Cuerquia, Valdivia and Yarumal.|MDRCO015
2609|A landslide on the left bank caused a temporary blockage in the river's flow, and the sustained accumulation caused the dammed water to overflow and flow through ducts along the upper construction areas.|MDRCO015
2610|The water accumulated at a rate of between 10 and 20 cm3/h within 367 meters of the dam’s capacity.|MDRCO015
2611|Additionally, there was only one outlet for water and that was through the turbine chamber, which flowed at a rate of between 800 and 1,000 m3/second.|MDRCO015
2612|When the disaster hit, there was no control over the water flowing through the tunnels.|MDRCO015
2613|These circumstances created a scenario of imminent risk to the communities downstream of the dam.|MDRCO015
2614|As a precautionary and maximum alert measure, evacuation plans were activated in downstream communities such as Corregimiento Puerto Valdivia, Cáceres, Tarazá and Caucasia.|MDRCO015
2615|The workers at the hydroelectric project were also quickly evacuated and taken to safe locations.|MDRCO015
2616|On 14 May 2018, the departmental government of Antioquia declared a state of public disaster.|MDRCO015
2617|At the time, the governor of Antioquia estimated that 113,000 people could be affected if the dam burst.|MDRCO015
2618|At the beginning of this Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) operation, locations downstream from the project and along the banks of the Cauca River such as Ituango, Briceño, Valdivia (Corregimiento Puerto Valdivia), Cáceres, Tarazá, Caucasia and Nechí, were put under a state of maximum alert.|MDRCO015

2634|On 12 March 2015, the Turrialba Volcano in the Canton of Turrialba in the province of Cartago, which has an approximate elevation of 3,340 meters above sea level with a volcanic edifice 1,900 of meters high, began expelling ash into the air.|MDRCR012
2635|Three similar events were registered that same day at 10:52, 13:38 and 14:50 local time, with the last one being the most intense.|MDRCR012
2636|As a result of these eruptions and due to wind conditions prevailing in the Central Valley area, a dispersion cloud formed covering most of the northern Central Valley sector, even causing the Juan Santamaría International Airport to suspend operations for over 24 hours.|MDRCR012
2637|This situation caused alarm among the population in the affected sectors; although the Turrialba Volcano has been active since 2001 with increased activity since 2010, this is the first time that ash has fallen with this intensity.|MDRCR012
2638|The volcano continues to be active, periodically spewing ash toward the western side of the crater.|MDRCR012
2639|This activity continues to place 18,450 people (3,690 families) at risk.|MDRCR012
2644|On 20 June 2015, a tropical wave entered Costa Rica, which brought heavy rains in mainly the Atlantic watersheds and the area of Sarapiqui in the province of Heredia; the heavy rains were followed by three more consecutive storm fronts, which brought uninterrupted rains for three more weeks.|MDRCR013
2645|This ended up affecting even northern areas of the country and the area of Turrialba in Cartago.|MDRCR013
2646|In its latest status report, the Costa Rican government's National Emergency Commission (CNE) reported the following damages and impact: 322 affected communities 3,308 flooded dwellings 45 stretches of road affected 59 damaged bridges 33 flooded education centres 8,809 people cut off 46 damaged aqueducts 9,666 people affected (preliminarily).|MDRCR013

2661|According to the National Hurricane Centre in Miami, Hurricane Otto entered Costa Rica territory close to the town of Los Chiles as a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale (wind gusts up to 175 km/h) on 24 November 2016, which qualified Otto as the southernmost hurricane on record to hit Central America.|MDRCR015
2662|Hurricane Otto moved on a west south-west trajectory at an average speed of 15 km/h across Costa Rica before exiting the country on 25 November.|MDRCR015
2663|The rains that fell along its path across Costa Rica triggered multiple Red and Yellow Alerts from the National Emergency Operation Committee (NEOC).|MDRCR015
2664|According to the Ministry of Public Works and Transport's National Highway Administration Council (CONAVI for its acronym in Spanish), damage to transport infrastructure (roads and bridges) was estimated at around 4,734 million Costa Rica colones (approx. 8.8 million US dollars).|MDRCR015
2665|CONAVI reported that the greatest impact occurred in the central region, with 63 damaged roads, followed by the Brunca Region with 41, Huetar Altántica with 35, Chorotega with 7 and Huetar Norte with 4, and it reported that only the roads in the Central Pacific area remained unscathed.|MDRCR015
2666|An airlift operation, which arrived on 25 and 26 November 2016, was conducted with Costa Rica, Panamanian and American aircraft to distribute food, medicine and hygiene items to hard-to-reach areas, especially in Alta Talamanca and in Pacífico Sur, where some communities were cut off.|MDRCR015
2705|A long continuous drought combined with heavy rainfall attributed to the El Niño phenomenon and climate change over the past two years brought difficult times for Cuba.|MDRCU003
2706|In recent years, rainfall patterns during both the dry and rainy seasons have not reached normal historical values, which has caused a decrease in groundwater resources and the drying up of the rivers and dams on which the population depends on for its water supply.|MDRCU003
2707|Cuba is now suffering from the effects of climate change, especially temperature rise and a severe drought, which is considered the worst in the last 115 years.|MDRCU003
2708|Decreased accumulated rainfall for more than 12 months caused the country’s dams to drop 38 per cent below their capacity; in addition, 98 water reservoirs were below 25 per cent and 26 were completely dry at the time of the writing of this report.|MDRCU003
2709|The National Institute of Water Resources (INRH for its acronym in Spanish) reported that the situation was getting more complex and critical due to the long drought and the continuous drop in the levels of the dams.|MDRCU003
2710|The driest groundwater basins were in the Eastern region of the country, especially in the Santiago de Cuba province, which has a population of 1,057,404 inhabitants: 71 per cent in urban areas and 29 per cent in rural areas.|MDRCU003
2711|With less than 30 per cent of water capacity in reservoirs and rainfall dropping below historical averages, this region was facing one of the most severe droughts in the country’s history.|MDRCU003
2712|The province of Santiago de Cuba has nine municipalities, four of which were the most affected by the drought: Santiago de Cuba, Palma Soriano, III Frente and Guamá; the drought affected approximately 520,560 people (94,000 families), and urban areas were the most seriously affected.|MDRCU003
2713|May is considered the rainiest month in Cuba (onset of the rainy season); however, rainfall has decreased significantly due to climate variability, particularly in Santiago de Cuba.|MDRCU003
2714|The beginning of the rainy season (from May to October) was affected by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event, which has persisted in the equatorial Pacific Ocean since early 2015, reaching its peak in November of the same year.|MDRCU003
2715|Currently, most models forecast a transition to a neutral condition during spring in the Northern Hemisphere and show the likelihood of La Niña re-emerging during the summer.|MDRCU003
2716|Usually when a strong El Niño event decreases in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean, rainfall during the onset of the rainy season tends to drop below average, particularly between May and June; nonetheless, it is important to note that not all El Niño events behave similarly due to the changing patterns of ocean-atmospheric circulation.|MDRCU003
2717|The Cuban government has been supplying drinking water through water trucks; however, the long drought has exceeded their capacity and therefore a relief intervention is needed.|MDRCU003
2718|In this regard, the government set up a water distribution system based on water cycles, which consisted of supplying water during a 24-hour period to specific areas and then suspending the service for several days, which affected water storage at the household level.|MDRCU003
2719|For this reason, government authorities and the Cuban Red Cross identified a great need in the communities for water containers to increase water storage capacity in households and meet the affected families’ needs.|MDRCU003
2720|The provision of 1,500-litre water tanks to health centres with the aim of increasing their water storage capacity was also been identified as a priority; other actions included the provision of 200-litre tanks and 10-litre buckets for the storage of drinking water in households.|MDRCU003

3002|The heavy rained coupled with exceptionally high winds forced the government to close both ports in Suez and Said, and led to the closure of schools and blockage of roads.|MDREG013
3003|This heavy rains led as well to house damages and power cut across the Red Sea governorate.|MDREG013
3085|Heavy rains and corresponding flash floods as a result of the El Niño phenomenon and the regular Belg rains (March – May) occurred in the Eastern and Southern parts of Ethiopia in April 2016.|MDRET017
3086|The Belg rains, though late in onset, were heavier than usual both in terms of intensity and geographic coverage.|MDRET017
3087|The first reports of flash floods and subsequent displacements of communities, especially in Somali region, was reported and responded to from 7 April.|MDRET017
3088|The rains intensified and spread during the following weeks, with the latest flash floods on 4 May 2016 affecting and displacing residents in Oromia region namely in West Harerghe zone (Hawi Gudina woreda) and Arsi zone (Seru woreda and Chole woreda).|MDRET017
3089|An assessment conducted by ERCS branch officers immediately after the occurrence of the disaster indicated that in West Harerghe zone of Hawi Gudina woreda eight people died, five were injured and 3,179 heads of livestock lost.|MDRET017
3090|In Arsi zone Seru woreda, the heavy rains and flash floods resulted in the displacement of 1500 households and in Chole woreda, 405 households were displaced and 17 houses destroyed In addition, the April-May flooding devastated many areas that are currently suffering from a drought that has put 10.2 million people in need of assistance in most regions of the country.|MDRET017
3097|On 8 September 2017, rainfall attributed to the Kiremt rains began falling in Ethiopia, leading to extensive flooding.|MDRET018
3098|The Ambeira zone in Afar region, as well as special zones surrounding Addis Ababa (the capital), Jima, South-east Shewa, and South-west Shewa in the Oromia region were worst affected by the rains and flooding.|MDRET018

3101|Indeed, ethnic clashes led to the displacement of more than 45,000 HHs (225,000 people) from Oromia and Somali regions, including the neighbouring Hareri region.|MDRET018
3102|The floods and conflict affected the same areas in Oromia and Somali regions, therefore creating a complex situation.|MDRET018
3103|To support Ethiopia Red Cross in responding to these floods, on 22 September 2017, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), through its Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) launched an operation for CHF 269,051 to reach 2,103 households or 10,515 people with provision of essential emergency relief and shelter assistance for a period of three months.|MDRET018
3104|However, on 20 December 2017, the operation was extended by two months through an operations update, bringing the operational timeframe to five months.|MDRET018
3105|Indeed, this no-cost timeframe extension was to enable completion of procurement of Emergency Shelter/NFI kits and to allow ERCS to reallocate 27,773.41 Swiss francs planned for the “Inception workshop”, “monitoring and distribution” and “transportation” budget lines to offset the projected over expenditure under ES/NFI procurement caused by increase in prices on the local market.|MDRET018
3106|This extension also allowed for completion of procurement of items for replenishment.|MDRET018

3228|Since the 1990 National Conference, which saw the establishment of a multi-party political system, the electoral process in Gabon has always been contested.|MDRGA007
3229|In some instances, this has led to violence between security forces and supporters of parties opposing the election results.|MDRGA007
3230|In August 2009, the results of the presidential election, led to demonstrations, destruction of property and loss of life in the cities of Libreville, Orem and Port-Gentile.|MDRGA007
3231|Since 2009, the political situation in Gabon has remained highly volatile, and was exacerbated by the death of a leading member of the opposition, resignations from the ruling party, as well as resistance to the candidature of the incumbent President for re-election in 2016.|MDRGA007
3232|In Libreville, the capital, reports of demonstrations and destruction of property in connection with the elections was signalled.|MDRGA007
3233|Learning from this troubled election history, the Gabonese Red Cross anticipated social unrest associated with the 2016 presidential elections – skirmishes between opposition supporters and those of the incumbent President started occurring in July 2016 during the electoral campaign.|MDRGA007
3234|In June 2016, two months before the elections, the National Society (NS) started working on a contingency plan with support from ICRC and coordination with IFRC.|MDRGA007
3235|A CHF 41,854 DREF allocation and IFRC’s Yaoundé Central Africa Country Cluster Office technical support, enabled the NS to train and equip its emergency teams.|MDRGA007
3236|Two simulation exercises one in Libreville and the other in Port-Gentile – were conducted.|MDRGA007
3237|The funds also facilitated the purchase and dispatching of first aid kits from Yaoundé, Cameroon to Libreville, Gabon by road.|MDRGA007
3238|In addition, Gabonese Red Cross volunteers were trained on first aid techniques, which they started using on 31 August 2016 when the provisional results of the elections were announced and the violence erupted.|MDRGA007
3239|The presidential elections in Gabon took place on 27 August 2016.|MDRGA007
3240|The provisional results of the elections were announced by the Interior Minister on 31 August around 16h00 local time, presenting the incumbent President as the winner.|MDRGA007
3241|This announcement was followed by heated debates at the national electoral commission (CENAP), in particular about suspicious results from the Haut-Ogoué province where turnout was allegedly 99.93 percent and the incumbent President receiving 95.3 percent of the votes.|MDRGA007
3242|Claiming fraud, the Vice-President of the electoral commission, who represents the opposition, resigned shortly before the announcement of the provisional results.|MDRGA007
3243|Representatives of the opposition in the electoral commission abstained from voting during the secret ballot to validate the results.|MDRGA007
3244|Immediately after this announcement, the main opposition leader, who had claimed victory before the announcement, rejected the results.|MDRGA007
3245|Shortly after, violent clashes were reported in the cities of Libreville and Port-Gentil with opposition members seen marching in protest in the cities of Mouila, Lambarene, Koula-Moutou and Oyem.|MDRGA007
3246|Besides clashes with police forces, angry protesters looted, destroyed and burned both private and public houses and buildings, including those hosting the National Assembly, the Senate, and the headquarters of the National health and social insurance fund of the Estuaire province.|MDRGA007
3247|In addition, there was looting and burning of vehicles and several commercial places in Libreville and Port-Gentil.|MDRGA007
3248|Disorder and social unrest continued until 6 September in many places in the country, resulting in at least 15 deaths as reported by several sources, including authorities, UN agencies and Gabonese Red Cross.|MDRGA007
3249|On day four following the announcement of the results, the main market of the Bitam Prefecture, a locality close to the border with Cameroon, was burned down by protesters.|MDRGA007
3250|On 8 September, the main opposition leader submitted an appeal to the Constitutional Court, requesting a polling station-level recount of all votes in the contested Haut-Ogoué province.|MDRGA007
3251|He also requested the presence of international observers during the recounting of votes.|MDRGA007
3252|The ruling by the Constitutional Court – accused of serving the incumbent should not last more than two weeks.|MDRGA007
3253|In parallel, the Gabonese Minister of Foreign Affairs announced the indefinite postponement of the previously planned visit of an African Union (AU) high-level mission.|MDRGA007
3254|These two decisions were causing the possibility of further frustration among a significant percentage of the Gabonese population and fuelled further violence.|MDRGA007
3255|Given the situation and the risks associated with it, a high alert level was maintained by Gabonese Red Cross as well as ICRC and IFRC.|MDRGA007
3256|The crisis began to quell down in early October 2016 but, the NS continued with the active watch on the ground.|MDRGA007
3257|Depending on information on the evolution of the situation on the ground from the deployed military teams, the NS developed a plan for active watch (deployment of teams on the field and at national headquarters) and passive watch (teams remained on alert but in their homes).|MDRGA007
3258|As time went by, the NS also reduced the number of volunteers deployed and by 15 November 2016, the contingency plan mechanisms were completely lifted.|MDRGA007
3259|Since November 2016, there have been no major demonstrations in the country.|MDRGA007
3260|However, it is important to note that to date, things have not really returned to normal in Gabon.|MDRGA007
3261|Indeed, there have been no protests because of the presence of the military personnel on the streets but, the crisis remains silent and could re-escalate at any moment.|MDRGA007
3262|Had the DREF funds not been earmarked, it would have been very important to use part of the balance to further strengthen the National Society's operational capacities in terms of response (training / retraining, NDRT, pre-positioning, etc.).|MDRGA007

3315|In total, 2,200 households (8,800 people) were affected by the disaster in the above mentioned regions.|MDRGE010
3316|On 13 June 2015, the situation escalated when heavy rains lasting five to six hours caused mud flow, and flash flooding of the rivers Vere and Mtkvari seriously hitting different central districts of the capital city Tbilisi and the surrounding villages.|MDRGE010
3317|The disaster claimed 20 lives, left 3 people missing, affected 380 families, 280 of which were left temporarily homeless in Tbilisi.|MDRGE010
3318|These temporarily homeless people were relocated in hotels and private apartments offered and financially covered by the Tbilisi City Hall, the mayor`s office.|MDRGE010

3369|The Meteorological Services forecast indicated that more heavy rainstorms and rains were expected creating the fears that the situation could deteriorate even further.|MDRGH011
3370|It was also anticipated that continuous use of stagnant/ contaminated water as observed during initial assessments, would pose serious public health problems, especially given the country continues to be endemic to cholera and other waterborne diseases.|MDRGH011
3371|On 11 June 2015, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) released CHF 108,115 from the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to support the Ghana Red Cross Society respond to the needs of 5,096 people with emergency relief, health care services, water, and sanitation and hygiene promotion, for a period of three months.|MDRGH011

3400|The number of cases detected in periurban communities in Cape Coast Metropolitan continued to rise from 36 cases on the 26 October, to 117 cases on 30 October.|MDRGH012
3401|By 2nd of November, the total number of cases had risen to 172 with zero deaths.|MDRGH012

3403|Central region is made up of 26 districts, six of these districts reported cholera cases.|MDRGH012
3404|The districts were Cape Coast Municipal, Abura Asebu Kwamankese, Komenda Edina Eguafo Abrem, Twifo Hermang, Asekuma Odoben Brakwa and Mfantseman districts.|MDRGH012
3405|The Cape Coast Municipal recorded 138 cases representing 80% of the total 172 cases reported by the 2nd of November 2016.|MDRGH012

3433|A total of seven political parties had filed and contested the elections, however, the contest was keenly between the ruling National Democratic Congress and the New Patriotic Party.|MDRGH013
3434|In the run-up to the elections, allegations and counter allegations were peddled between the ruling government and opposition parties especially the largest opposition party, the New Patriotic Party, in respect of the compiled voters register to be used for the elections.|MDRGH013
3435|It was alleged that the register contained foreigners to the advantage of the incumbent government, the growing suspicion that the National Democratic Party was poised to rig the elections and cling to power.|MDRGH013
3436|The existence of more volatile constituencies in the regions especially where there is a presence of the two biggest parties could generate insecurity during the elections.|MDRGH013
3437|It was against this background that the GRCS activated its drafted election contingency plan and mobilized, trained and deployed volunteers before, during and after the elections to provide first aid services in the unlikely event of any election related violence.|MDRGH013
3438|The IFRC therefore provided an amount of43,841 swiss francs upon request from the GRCS to support the operational plan in respect to the election.|MDRGH013

3475|In April 2017, Ghana experienced a sharp alteration in its weather which resulted in widespread flooding reported in over five regions out of which four were heavily affected.|MDRGH014
3476|These floods caused devastating impact to people’s health, safety and destruction to properties and livelihood.|MDRGH014
3477|The reported flooding across the country also caused devastation which communities and government were unable to cope with or even recover from as; farmers lost their investments in production, communities were helplessly being displaced and some infrastructure, such as roads and buildings collapsed.|MDRGH014
3478|By 10th of July 2017, about four regions including Greater Accra, East, West and Central Regions were declared to have flood emergencies with potential to cause devastation.|MDRGH014

3535|The Gambia went to the polls on 01 December 2016, to elect the President for 5 years.|MDRGM011
3536|In the leadup, to the election, the atmosphere in the country was tense.|MDRGM011
3537|Back in April 2016, a protest march organized by the opposition resulted in injuries and arrests.|MDRGM011
3538|History also revealed that during the past 4 Presidential elections, there were incidents between the National security forces and the opposition.|MDRGM011
3539|In this context, there was high risk of unrest during the election.|MDRGM011
3540|The Gambia Red Cross Society (GRCS), as part of its mission to save lives and promote dignity wherever applicable, developed a Contingency Plan based on an analysis of the evolving situation.|MDRGM011
3541|The Election Preparedness and Response Plan (EPRP) focused on potential hotspot areas at risk of election-related events.|MDRGM011
3542|The EPRP envisaged a) training of volunteers across the 7 Branches of the National Society, preparing first aid materials and prepositioning non-food items (NFIs).|MDRGM011
3543|The IFRC through its Country Cluster in Dakar released 39,711 Swiss francs from its Disaster Response Emergency Funds (DREF) to support the National Society in its preparedness activities.|MDRGM011
3544|The operation was implemented within the timeframe (12 days).|MDRGM011
3545|However, exactly 8 days after the Elections and the acceptance of the results by the incumbent President a television announcement stunned the Nation on 9 December 2016, saying that he rejected the election results, declaring that he was still the president until a new election was conducted.|MDRGM011
3546|In this context, the Emergency Plan of Action (EPoA) was revised and the timeframe extended till 31 December 2016.|MDRGM011
3547|An additional budget allocation of 35,911Swiss francs was allocated.|MDRGM011
3548|The revised EPoA was geared towards ensuring a monitoring and supervision of the Post-Election phase, considering the risks generated by the contest of the results of the elections.|MDRGM011
3549|Indeed, the operation focused on a) the mobilization and deployment of volunteers and staff within the 7 at-risk branches, monitoring of the security situation by community volunteers, both on-site emergency and national coordination.|MDRGM011

3588|From 24 July – 3 August 2015, rainfall in Guinea resulted in heavy flooding that caused casualties and significant property damage, in several localities including Beyla, Conakry, Forécariah, Macenta, Siguiri and Télimélé.|MDRGN008
3589|In the region of Conakry, in the six prefectures of all five communes namely Matoto Dixinn, Ratoma, Kaloum, Matam, were severely affected by the floods.|MDRGN008
3590|According to the joint assessments 29,599 people were affected, of which 4,925 households had lost their homes.|MDRGN008
3591|Most of the areas affected had suffered from cholera epidemics in the past and were at risk again and there was need for early control since the health facilities in the country had already been impacted by the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak that was declared in March 2014.|MDRGN008
3592|On 12 August 2015, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) released CHF 130,603 from the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to support the Red Cross Society of Guinea (RCSG) respond to the immediate needs of 1,500 households (9,000 people) affected by the floods, with interventions in the areas of emergency relief, shelter, health and care, water, sanitation and hygiene promotion for a period of three months.|MDRGN008
3593|On 19 October 2015, an Operations Update was issued to extend the timeframe of the DREF operation by one month to enable the completion of activities planned, which had been complicated following the re-evaluation of the situation, and preparedness for presidential elections (scheduled in October 2015), which had resulted in violence.|MDRGN008
3594|Please note that following a re-evaluation of the situation there were revisions made by the RCSG on the use of the DREF allocation that though were approved by the IFRC Guinea Country Delegation; were not authorized as per the agreed DREF procedures and guidelines by the DREF Appeal Manager (in Geneva).|MDRGN008
3595|It has been agreed (by the DREF Appeal Manager) that the expenditures outside of the agreed budget can be considered as eligible as they reflected a need to revise the activities planned to ensure they were relevant and appropriate to the needs of the affected population; and also resulted in an increase in the expenditures incurred for direct beneficiary related costs versus support costs.|MDRGN008
3596|The IFRC Guinea Country Delegation and RCSG have received a reminder of the DREF guidelines and procedures, as in future, any non-compliance will result in expenditures being disallowed.|MDRGN008
3597|This DREF has been partially replenished by the Netherlands Red Cross DG Echo and the Canadian Red Cross/Govt.|MDRGN008

3613|Guinea experiencing a measles outbreak, officially declared on February 8, 2017.|MDRGN009
3614|A response plan was put in place by the National Health Security Agency (NHSA) and partners.|MDRGN009
3615|It was decided to target children from 6 months to 10 years in 31 health districts.|MDRGN009
3616|The reasons for the choice of these zones to respond are as follows: the speed of propagation of the epidemic in the different districts of the country keeps increasing; the imminent approach of the dry season (March) that promotes the spread of measles; the highly contagious character of the disease (Ro> 15); the large number of districts bordering other countries (Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone, Mali, Liberia and Côte d’Ivoire) with major risk of spreading to these countries if the epidemic is not controlled in Guinea; high population movements in the country that favour/facilitate the spread of the disease; The likely underestimated number of cases and deaths due to the weakness of epidemiological surveillance.|MDRGN009
3617|Although the NHSA is efficient through its impressive indicators (100%) and timeliness (87%), we should say that this surveillance is not exhaustive because private entities are not integrated in the surveillance.|MDRGN009
3618|Health posts do not necessarily report to the health centres located in their health zones.|MDRGN009
3619|A lot of discrepancies have been found on the ground where the quality of data transmitted from the lower levels to the NHSA is questioned; The fragile target population (child mortality and malnutrition among children under 5 years is significant, insufficient national vaccine coverage estimated at 63% and uneven in the different districts, partial suspension of routine EPI during the Ebola outbreak) and limited access to health facilities, in a post-Ebola context.|MDRGN009
3620|Due to lack of financial, material and logistics means to deal with the epidemic synchronously in the 31 health districts, the Ministry of Health through the NHSA decided in accordance with its TFP1 to go step by step where the Nzerekore region was the first before that of the 05 municipalities / communes of Conakry.|MDRGN009
3621|In the prefecture of Nzerekore, 738 suspected cases were reported with 5 cases confirmed by the laboratory and nearly 700 cases confirmed by epidemiological link.|MDRGN009
3622|This makes this zone the epicentre of the epidemic.|MDRGN009
3623|Therefore, the Ministry of Health and its partners decided to conduct a vaccination campaign against measles coupled with the administration of vitamin A and mebendazole particularly in the health district of Nzerekore.|MDRGN009
3624|It is in this context that the Guinean Red Cross with financial support from the IFRC through the DREF measles 2017 decided to support the Ministry of Health specifically for the implementation of communication / social mobilization activities and active search of suspected cases in the community.|MDRGN009
3625|For this social mobilization campaign in the fight against measles, the key actors were the Guinea Red Cross (GRC) / IFRC and UNICEF.|MDRGN009
3633|On 4 July 2017, heavy rainfall hit the forest region of Guinea in the Prefecture of Nzerekore, causing serious property damages.|MDRGN010
3634|Areas which suffered considerable damages were all located in the urban district area of Nzerekore and they included: Quartier commercial, Kwitiapolou, Wessoua, Dorota 1, Horaya, Gbanghana, Belle Vue and Nyeh.|MDRGN010
3635|The assessment reportedly found out that there were 13 injured persons and 55 families pushed to seek shelter in public infrastructures.|MDRGN010
3636|Two (2) cases of diarrhoea and 13 cases of fever were equally recorded amongst the displaced persons.|MDRGN010
3637|According to the joint Red Cross Government assessment, some 3,274 people were affected (i.e. 545 households) of which 1,038 men 1,089 women and 1,147 children.|MDRGN010
3638|All affected areas had suffered from the previous Ebola crisis in 2014 -2015 and the poor health situation prevailing in the country.|MDRGN010
3639|A DREF operation was launched on 18 July 2017 for CHF 165,801 to enable Guinea Red Cross Society (GRCS) to respond to the immediate needs of all affected 545 households, with specific interventions in the areas of emergency relief, shelter, health and care, water, sanitation and hygiene promotion for a period of three months.|MDRGN010
3640|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), AECID, the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRGN010

3665|On 15 November 2017, the towns of Mandra, Megara and Nea Peramos, which are all towns in the West Attica region of Greece (approx. 30 min drive from Athens) were flooded.|MDRGR002
3666|Mandra – a town of 13,5002 inhabitants – was the most severely affected, where a wave of water suddenly rushed through the city, killing people, carrying away hundreds of cars, and devastating houses and property.|MDRGR002
3667|The majority of the population was affected by the floods.|MDRGR002
3668|The most immediate impact was the loss of life.|MDRGR002
3669|A total of 23 deaths have been reported, and 24 injured.|MDRGR002
3670|Secondly, basements and ground floors of buildings in the city were also seriously impacted; officials estimated 80 per cent of the city area had been affected, except for some located on the hills.|MDRGR002
3671|According to the Ministry of Infrastructure, out of 544 surveyed, 428 buildings were damaged and in need of restoration (specifically 319 houses, 62 business spaces, one public building and 46 warehouses and basements).|MDRGR002
3672|The water coursed through some of the main streets, also laying waste to all the store and business-fronts on its path.|MDRGR002
3673|Watermarks were visible at anywhere from 1 to 2.5 metres in height.|MDRGR002
3674|Some houses were totally, others were partially destroyed, with many basements flooded.|MDRGR002
3675|All possessions, from clothes, to personal items to household appliances were destroyed.|MDRGR002
3676|For the first week, potable water was not available through the municipality's water distribution network.|MDRGR002
3677|Access to telecommunications and electricity was also initially cut off.|MDRGR002
3678|Hundreds of crushed vehicles were scattered and blocking the streets.|MDRGR002
3679|Significantly, the heating system for most people depended on boilers in the basements and was destroyed.|MDRGR002
3680|With the rains and winter continuing and ongoing, this was a major concern.|MDRGR002
3681|Lastly, the psychological impact was substantial.|MDRGR002
3682|The volunteers who conducted the survey for the assessment ended up providing psychological first aid (PFA) to many of the people who were traumatized by the floods.|MDRGR002
3683|Approximately 40 people were hosted in a hotel in the nearby town of Elefsina while the majority of the affected people stayed with relatives living in the town or in Athens.|MDRGR002
3684|Many people also preferred to stay in their destroyed homes as incidents of looting were reported.|MDRGR002
3685|The main needs were related to food, psychosocial support, household appliances, cleaning of the debris and mud from businesses and houses, clothes, medicines, money and potable water.|MDRGR002
3686|The government stated that indemnifications in the form of EUR 5,000 for households and EUR 8,000 for businesses would be given to the affected population, and this began to be implemented in mid-December.|MDRGR002
3687|The floods ended up being the deadliest event in terms of disasters in recent years in Greece.|MDRGR002
3714|The La Pasión River located in the municipality of Sayaxché in the department of Petén is part of Guatemala's protected areas.|MDRGT007
3715|In June 2015, according to the National Risk Reduction Coordinating Centre (CONRED), oxidation ponds of an oil producer in the area overflowed due to heavy rain, contaminating the La Pasión River.|MDRGT007
3716|The river is 345 km long 150 of which are affected by the contamination) and fed by many important sources which discharge significant amounts in this department.|MDRGT007
3717|According to official data, Sayaxché has approximately 76,482 inhabitants, of whom 87 per cent live in rural areas, 72 per cent belong to indigenous populations (mainly Q’eqchis) 76.3 per cent live in poverty, 29.4 per cent in extreme poverty and 34 per cent suffer from chronic and acute malnutrition (data recorded in the Governance Pact).|MDRGT007
3718|The main economic activities are fishing, agriculture and agricultural work on palm plantations; thirty-six per cent of palmcultivated land is in Sayaxché.|MDRGT007
3719|Many communities lack running and/or chlorinated or treated water for domestic consumption.|MDRGT007
3720|Some communities have wells, but residents never know the level of purity of the water they extract.|MDRGT007
3721|It is clear that many communities depend almost entirely on the La Pasión River and related streams.|MDRGT007
3722|Communities south of Sayaxché report at least 3 instances in the last five years involving the contamination of streams, wells and hydrographical network that resulted from discharges of agro-chemicals from local industry.|MDRGT007
3723|Agriculture is the predominant activity in the region, with 51.09 per cent of the population engaging in it.|MDRGT007
3724|In 2008, the main products were corn, beans, squash, rice, jalapeño peppers, cobanero, zambo, watermelon, peanut, and pineapple, but cultivation of African Palm has increased in recent years.|MDRGT007
3725|According to the National Council for Protected Areas (CONAP), 16 per cent of the land in the municipality belongs to private palm enterprises.|MDRGT007
3726|Livestock production accounts for 12.93 per cent of the municipality's economy.|MDRGT007
3727|This involves the breeding and fattening of cattle; therefore, large tracts of land belonging to a few are used for this productive activity.|MDRGT007
3728|Craft production accounts for 24.52 per cent of the municipality's economy, in which carpentry is especially strong; fishing, iron foundry, bakery, wood handicrafts, tailoring, candle-making and hammock production are additional livelihoods within the communities.|MDRGT007
3729|Results of the first water samples taken by the Toxicology Laboratory at the University of San Carlos in Guatemala were obtained on 10 June 2015, which indicated the presence of an organophosphorus pesticide (Malathion).|MDRGT007
3730|This has caused the massive death of fish and other aquatic animal species in the ecosystem, and it is considered the most serious environmental problem of its kind in the national territory1.|MDRGT007
3731|On 12 June 2015, the governor of Petén declared an orange alert for the entire department, and the mayor of Sayaxché declared a red alert on that same day.|MDRGT007
3732|These are still in place in order to prioritize emergency assistance.|MDRGT007
3733|According to CONRED’s 30 June report: 22 communities are affected 14,827 people are at risk 12,017 people are affected.|MDRGT007
3734|It is important to mention that the investigation is stalled after four and a half months after the massive die-off of fish in the La Pasión River, which affected 185 km downstream from the source of the pollution and was classified by authorities as an ecocide.|MDRGT007
3735|As a result of the stalled investigation, communities are alleging that authorities do not care about safeguarding their lives and that there is neither adequate information nor interest in resolving the problem.|MDRGT007
3736|The first and second United Nations (UN) Situation Reports were released on the third week in July (http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/GT-Informe_Sit_Contaminacion_No_2.pdf).|MDRGT007
3737|This study conducted by a UN inter-agency team, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS-NET) and environmental experts from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) confirmed the results of the assessment performed by the Guatemalan Red Cross and supplements the information with protection data.|MDRGT007
3738|It is important to highlight that Malathion is very toxic to aquatic organisms and dangerous to both the environment and human beings.|MDRGT007
3739|However, given that there is no Malathion contamination in the La Pasión River to date, local authorities have decreased the alert level and emergency operations centre meetings to monitor this emergency to every fifteen days.|MDRGT007
3740|Furthermore, decreasing the alert level will allow local authorities to initiate recovery actions.|MDRGT007
3741|Nevertheless, the Guatemalan Red Cross, with support from the Spanish Red Cross for CHF 45,140, began the exit process, which includes building cisterns in communities to collect rainwater, repairing water systems, cleaning wells, distributing water filters and intensifying hygiene promotion actions; these measures are contributing positively to communities affected by the contamination of the La Pasión river.|MDRGT007
3750|On Thursday, 1 October 2015 at 21:30 hours, a massive landslide caused by heavy rains affected a sector known as El Cambray II in the municipality of Santa Catarina Pinula in Guatemala, displacing some 17,689 m2 of earth2.|MDRGT008
3751|According to the 13 October 2015 report issued by CONRED, 70 people were missing, at least 280 were found dead and more than 100 homes were buried.|MDRGT008
3752|Search and rescue found some 34 people still alive and evacuated 445 others.|MDRGT008
3753|Approximately 407 people were housed in temporary collective centres set up by municipal authorities.|MDRGT008
3771|On 18 September 2017, heavy rains caused flooding in much of the country, especially in Guatemala's south-western regions.|MDRGT011
3772|In Suchitepéquez and Retalhuleu Departments, the floods damaged homes, crops and household goods, affecting 2,016 families according to local authorities.|MDRGT011
3773|The Guatemalan Red Cross deployed its Damage Assessment and Needs Analysis (DANA) teams to Retalhuleu and Suchitepéquez, which found severe damage to the water network, including artisanal water wells, and to several homes; the inhabitants of these homes lost all their belongings.|MDRGT011
3774|The Guatemalan Red Cross delegations in Suchitepéquez and Retalhuleu initially provided pre-hospital care and evacuated at-risk families to safer ground; they also participated in several coordination meetings with the various departmental Disaster Coordinating Centres (CODRED) to pool and share timely information.|MDRGT011
3775|The heavy rains that affected Guatemala since early September through October 2017 delayed the original plan of action’s response activities for Suchitepéquez and Retalhuleu, requiring a one-month extension to the operation.|MDRGT011
3788|Since the beginning of September 2017, heavy rainfall affected Guatemala; despite the increased precipitation, soil saturation gradually decreased in some parts of the country.|MDRGT012
3789|However, on 28 October 2018, Tropical Storm Selma dumped 250 mm of rainfall in Guatemala, increasing soil saturation and causing landslides and flooding, which severely affected the department of Alta Verapaz; October’s heavy rainfall wreaked havoc on towns such as La Franja del Polochic, Tactic and Cobán in the department of Alta Verapaz, leaving them cut off and in need of humanitarian assistance.|MDRGT012
3790|The increased water levels and the overflow of the Cahabón, Chixoy, Icbolay and Polochic Rivers affected 62 rural and urban communities in 8 municipalities.|MDRGT012
3791|Authorities ordered a departmental red alert to tend the needs of the local population, and the government opened 13 collective centres to house more than 1,000 people whose homes were directly affected.|MDRGT012
3792|Alta Verapaz is one of the largest maize producers in Guatemala, accounting for 10 per cent of the country’s total production; however, crops were lost to the flooding, putting small and mediumsized plot farmers’ food security at risk, according to information provided by the GRC’s branch in Cobán.|MDRGT012
3793|Per official reports, 450 hectares owned by 1,097 families were affected in the municipalities of Chisec, Raxruhá and Panzós.|MDRGT012
3794|Many affected families acquired loans to purchase seeds and supplies needed for the second agricultural cycle, which began in November 2017; nonetheless, due to extensive crop losses, the affected families were unable to pay their debts, making their situation more precarious.|MDRGT012
3795|Moreover, the affected communities obtained their water from artesian wells, which were contaminated by mud and human and animal excrement by the flooding.|MDRGT012
3869|Heavy rainfall on Wednesday, 15 July 2015 and Thursday, 16 July 2015, with subsequent continuous rainfall resulted in increased water levels in rivers and canals and caused severe flooding in five regions in Guyana, namely BarimaWaini, Pomeroon-Supenaam, Essequibo Islands West Demerara, Demerara-Mahaica and Mahaica Berbice.|MDRGY002
3870|Assessments carried out by various agencies such as the Civil Defence Commission, National Drainage and Irrigation Authority (NDIA) and the Ministry of Public Health indicated that the floods had affected various parts of the regions, resulting in damages to houses, buildings, livestock, farms, cash crops and water and sanitation facilities.|MDRGY002
3871|As the lead agency, the Civil Defence Commission activated the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC), through which it responded to the emergency with support from various agencies, including the Guyana Red Cross Society.|MDRGY002
3872|At the time of this report, the emergency is over, the communities have resumed their normal activities and the Guyana Red Cross Society has resumed its everyday activities.|MDRGY002
3880|The country faced a truly alarming situation due to the increase in dengue and chikungunya cases reported nationwide, which were compounded by the emergence of the Zika virus.|MDRHN009
3881|From a public health standpoint, it was a complex situation both because of the existence of factors that favoured the reproduction of the mosquito that transmits the virus and a lack of expertise regarding timely detection and ways to prevent the spread of the virus.|MDRHN009
3882|Thanks to the efforts of all of the sectors involved, the curve of cases detected in the country is now on a downward trend compared to the levels seen at the beginning of this emergency.|MDRHN009
3883|In San Pedro Sula, one of the cities hardest hit by the virus according to Ministry of Health statistics, Zika levels dropped, although a nationwide alert is still being maintained as of the writing of this report.|MDRHN009
3884|Eight babies were reportedly born with microcephaly in southern Honduras, 6 in Choluteca and 2 in Francisco Morazán.|MDRHN009
3885|Furthermore, 493 pregnant women have contracted the virus, 60 of which have had a special test performed with support from the United States of America’s Centre for Disease Control (CDC) and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and tested positive for the virus.|MDRHN009
3886|Below are the official health statistics up until Epidemiological Week 29 (11 to 23 July 2016): The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross National Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United States of America, as well as DG ECHO, the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID), the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations, and other corporate and private donors.|MDRHN009

3915|November 2015:|MDRHN010
3916|The authorities at the National Migration Institute (INM for its acronym in Spanish) estimated that around 20,000 people – of mainly Cuban origin – passed through the region in 2014 and 2015.|MDRHN010
3917|August 2016: The INM’s Regional Office and the Centre for Assistance to Irregular Migrants (CAMI for its acronym in Spanish) received requests for assistance from an average of 2,500 migrants per month.|MDRHN010
3918|September 2016: The Honduran Red Cross signed a letter of understanding with the INM to coordinate the humanitarian response actions following the emergency that affected irregular migrants.|MDRHN010
3919|October 2016:|MDRHN010
3920|The HRC began implementing the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) operation: The HRC provided services to around 5,500 migrants, thereby exceeding the original target population of 4,000 migrants; the services included basic first aid care, the distribution of personal hygiene kits and key messages to promote hygiene as well as a restoring family links (RFL), which was jointly implemented with the ICRC, so that people could contact their families through the provision of a free telephone call.|MDRHN010
3921|The migrants were mainly of Caribbean origin from countries such as Haiti and Cuba, while a smaller percentage of migrants were from the continent of Africa, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Cameroon, Senegal, Angola, Kenya as well as Asian countries such as Bangladesh, Nepal, India, among others.|MDRHN010
3922|The situation at the CAMI evolved in terms of the number of migrants entering the country, ending with a low level of migrants at the close of the operations.|MDRHN010
3923|In January and February 2017, less than 1,200 migrants were received, meaning that the administrative process was faster.|MDRHN010
3924|In addition, there was less demand for the HRC’s services; however, there was high demand for first aid care, which was received positively by the migrants.|MDRHN010
3947|In October 2017, COPECO declared a green alert in the departments of Cortés, Yoro, Atlántida, Islas de La Bahía and Colón due to the intense rainfall caused by the first cold front of the season; On 24 October, the Honduran government declared a state of emergency in the departments of Cortés, Atlántida, Yoro, Colón, Islas de la Bahía and Gracias a Dios through Executive Decree PCM-069-20171.|MDRHN011

3949|The official data from COPECO on the flooding’s impact on the affected zone are below:|MDRHN011
3950|The Honduran government established 79 collective centres to house and protect the affected population; 73 of which were in northern parts of the country, specifically in San Pedro Sula, La Lima, Potrerillos, Villanueva, Pimienta, San Manuel, Puerto Cortés and Omoa in Cortés, Quimistán in Santa Bárbara and El Progreso in Yoro.|MDRHN011
3993|On 2 October 2015, the amount of CHF 361,559 was released from the IFRC Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to meet the immediate emergency needs of 70,700 migrants by providing food and non-food items, hygiene kits and restoring family links services.|MDRHR001
3994|The DREF Emergency Plan of Action was updated on 1 December 2015 to extend the operation’s timeframe until 30 January 2016.|MDRHR001
3995|The operating budget was revised in line with the winterisation needs and in response to the relocation of the main reception camp from Opatovac to another location in Slavonski Brod.|MDRHR001
3996|Since 16 September 2015, after the Hungarian authorities closed the border with Serbia, people on the move started arriving in Croatia.|MDRHR001
3997|Until 31 December 2015, some 555,761 refugees and migrants entered Croatia and were registered by the Croatian authorities.|MDRHR001
3998|The total arrivals in January 2016 were 64,826 people.|MDRHR001
3999|That makes a total of 623,068 arrivals from 16 September 2015 until 31 January 2016.|MDRHR001
4000|The main migration route went through the eastern border of Croatia with Serbia in the villages of Tovarnik and Babska.|MDRHR001
4001|In the first six weeks, the migrants were crossing the border on foot, and later they were transported by buses to the Temporary Reception Camp of Opatovac.|MDRHR001
4002|In line with the arrangement between the Croatian Government and the Serbian authorities, migrants and refugees started entering Croatia by train from the beginning of November 2015.|MDRHR001
4003|They were taken directly to the Winter Transit Reception Camp Slavonski Brod where they were registered by the police and sheltered.|MDRHR001
4004|The migrants were entitled to ask for asylum, but very few of them actually applied as almost all of them continued to move on to Western European countries.|MDRHR001
4005|Due to the high influx of people into Croatia, the Croatian Ministry of Interior set up a temporary reception centre in Opatovac on 21 September 2015.|MDRHR001
4006|With the weather conditions deteriorating, a decision was made by the Croatian authorities to set up a new winter reception camp on 3 November in Slavonski Brod while the one in Opatovac was put on stand-by.|MDRHR001
4007|The Croatian Red Cross (CRC) also moved all its activities to the new winter camp which caused some reorganization of the CRC operation as well as a reallocation of its operational costs.|MDRHR001
4008|The Croatian authorities invited the CRC to the new camp from the beginning as the main provider of basic services to the migrants and the coordinator of international organisations and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs).|MDRHR001
4009|Both reception camps in Opatovac and Slavonski Brod were constructed by the Croatian authorities with the full involvement of the Croatian Red Cross in the setting up of the shelter and community services activities inside the camps.|MDRHR001
4010|From 3 November 2015, thanks to the agreement between the authorities of Croatia and Serbia, migrants were transported by train from Šid in Serbia directly to Slavonski Brod in Croatia where they were registered and provided with all the necessary assistance.|MDRHR001
4011|Additionally, the trains took them directly to Dobova Camp in Slovenia in line with the agreement between the Croatian and Slovenian authorities.|MDRHR001
4012|Consequently, the migrants were not exposed to exhausting walking through the borderlines anymore and lesser migrants were at health risk than before.|MDRHR001
4013|During the entire process migrants spent an average of 24 hours at the Camp.|MDRHR001
4014|The reformed arrangement also contributed to a more effective use of resources of the CRC in facilitating relief provision as the majority of relief was distributed inside the camp.|MDRHR001
4015|Slavonski Brod Winter Reception Camp had been constructed around three solid buildings – one was used as the Croatian authorities headquarters of the operation, the second one as the Health clinic managed by the Ministry of Health and the third as the main warehouse managed by the Croatian Red Cross.|MDRHR001
4016|The heated tents (Rubb Halls) were built for registration of migrants (managed by the Ministry of Interior) and for temporary shelter of migrants in 6 sectors, while prefabricated accommodation containers were set up in the sectors for accommodation of families and vulnerable people, In between there were heated tents for distribution of food and NFIs, for other services such as RFL and PSS activities as well as area with tents and prefabricated accommodation containers for IOs and NGOs.|MDRHR001
4017|The Croatian Red Cross took care of organizing the provision of humanitarian assistance to the refugees and migrants.|MDRHR001
4018|The Croatian Red Cross was distributing food and water, baby supplies, hygiene items, and clothes.|MDRHR001
4019|It was also providing psychosocial support, Restoring Family Links services and interpretation services for Arabic, Farsi and Urdu.|MDRHR001
4020|The majority of relief was provided in the reception centres while at border entry points, relief items were distributed depending on the circumstances.|MDRHR001
4021|For the most part food items distributed to the people at the reception centre came from State Commodity Reserves.|MDRHR001
4022|Every person received food and non-food items (NFI) assistance from the Croatian Red Cross at least twice during their stay in Croatia.|MDRHR001
4023|All services provided by the authorities as well as the Croatian Red Cross were free of charge for the beneficiaries.|MDRHR001
4106|Hurricane Irma impacted Haiti on 7 September 2017 into the early hours of 8 September 2017.|MDRHT014
4107|The eye of the hurricane passed north-east of the coastline of the country, causing storm surges on the north coast and wind and flood damage to vulnerable communities.|MDRHT014
4108|The storm directly impacted Haiti’s three northern departments, with some flooding in two additional departments due to rainfall.|MDRHT014
4109|Preparedness activities included the pre-positioning of available stocks in the three northern departments, in conjunction with the HRCS disseminating key messages before the passage of the storm and assisting the DPC with the evacuation of affected people o designated collective centres; joint coordination meetings were also held with DPC and other stakeholders at the department level in the three northern departments.|MDRHT014
4161|On 21 June 2016, heavy rain and hailstorm hit Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg County in the north-eastern part of Hungary.|MDRHU005
4162|It was reported by the National Directorate General for Disaster Management (MoI NDGDM) that more than 750 had been damaged.|MDRHU005
4163|A few hours after the hailstorm the Hungarian Red Cross local branch started the initial needs assessment.|MDRHU005
4164|Parallel to this, the local authorities invited the Hungarian Red Cross provide assistance to the affected households.|MDRHU005
4165|The needs identified were mainly shelter materials for repairing the damaged rooftops and broken windows.|MDRHU005
4166|The assessment carried out by the Hungarian Red Cross staff and volunteers identified families and individuals living alone who are not able to carry out the works needed for the temporary coverage of the rooftops.|MDRHU005
4176|On 21 June 2017, hailstorm and heavy rains hit several parts of Hungary.|MDRHU006
4177|The village of Megyaszó in Borsod-Abaúj Zemplén County and villages scattered around the county capital Kecskemét in Bács-Kiskun County were particularly badly affected, with roofs, windows and vegetable gardens destroyed or greatly damaged.|MDRHU006
4178|The heavy rain entering the houses also led to the destruction of food, household items and appliances as well as the soaking of walls from the inside.|MDRHU006
4179|In Megyaszó, the hailstorm and heavy rains have damaged 183 houses, with 25 of them having become statically unstable and uninhabitable.|MDRHU006
4180|A total of 96 people were evacuated, including 53 children and accommodated with relatives.|MDRHU006
4181|There was also temporary power outage in 3,500 households in the wider region.|MDRHU006
4182|In Bács-Kiskun County, some 50 houses, including a kindergarten as well as farmsteads around the county capital Kecskemét have suffered serious damage, affecting 225 people.|MDRHU006
4183|In sum, a total of 233 houses have suffered serious damage as a result of the hailstorm and rain.|MDRHU006
4281|Forest and land fires in vast areas of Borneo (Kalimantan) and Sumatra resulted in a very dense haze starting from .|MDRID010
4282|The Centre for Health Crisis of the Ministry of Health reported that the forest fires started in the Riau Province and later spread into seven provinces, four in Kalimantan (West, East, South and Central Kalimantan) and three in Sumatra Island (Jambi, Riau and South Sumatra).|MDRID010
4283|Already in September 2015, the haze started affecting neighboring countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines.|MDRID010
4284|The effects of haze were increasingly amplified by the El Niño phenomenon that in the region caused a mild to severe drought and resulted in a significant delay of the rainy season, therefore delaying the beneficial effects of seasonal rains as a mitigating effect.|MDRID010
4285|The forest fires and the resulting haze have been the worst ever in terms of casualties, the duration of the event, the economic loss and the wide impact on people’s health and the environment.1The BMKG (National Meteorological, Climatology and Geophysics Agency) recorded more than 1,100 hotspots spread all over the affected area, mainly in the islands of Sumatera and Kalimantan and to a lesser extent in Papua.|MDRID010
4286|In Sumatera, a total of 771 hotspots were recorded as follows: 33 hotspots in Bengkulu, 99 in Jambi, 41 in Bangka Belitung, 42 in Lampung, 28 in Riau, 8 in West Sumatera and 530 in South Sumatera.|MDRID010
4287|In Kalimantan, a total of 332 hotspots were recorded spreading in the four provinces of West Kalimantan (22 hotspots), South Kalimantan (28 hotspots), Central Kalimantan (188 hotspots) and East Kalimantan (94 hotspots).|MDRID010
4288|The air pollutant index (API) level ranged between 150 to 1,950 µgram/m3 with the highest API (1,950 µgram/m3) recorded on 21 October 2015 in Central Kalimantan Province (normal condition is 0 to 50 µgram/m3).|MDRID010
4289|People, especially children, pregnant women, the elderly and people with pre-existing respiratory problems became more vulnerable to upper respiratory tract infection (URI), eye irritation, pneumonia, asthma, skin irritation, which resulted into 11 casualties.|MDRID010
4290|BNPB data shows that the people who particularly suffered from URI were located in Jambi province (around 150,000 people) and South Sumatera province (115,000 people).|MDRID010
4291|In the forest and land affected areas, the National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) recorded 2.61 million hectares of burnt land.|MDRID010
4292|Visibility went down to between 20 to 500 meters for weeks in most of the affected area, which caused delays or even cancellation of a number of flights in various provinces.|MDRID010
4293|This disaster also hampered daily activities and caused schools, universities and some offices to close down.|MDRID010
4294|During the first half of November 2015, a few heavy rains swept some of the provinces affected by forest fires, particularly those located close to the equator.|MDRID010
4295|By mid-November, rains had extinguished the majority of forest and land fires throughout Indonesia, while in some cases the risk of peat fires to re-ignite continued due to uncertain trends of the impact of El Nino.|MDRID010
4296|Despite the net improvement of the situation in late 2015, many people living in these affected areas continued to suffer from the effects of the previous long exposure to haze: data from the health services in West Kalimantan show that the number of respiratory infections remained high even after the end of forest fires.|MDRID010
4297|Due to protracted diminution of quantity of rain in some areas, the haze season is expected to come as early as April in 2016.|MDRID010
4298|To date BNPB has reported 151 hotspots in Sumatra and Kalimantan, while parts of Sumatra and Kalimantan have entered the first period of the dry season.|MDRID010
4299|The IFRC, on behalf of the PMI, would like to thank all partners for the generous contribution to the replenishment of this DREF.|MDRID010
4300|These include Netherlands Red Cross/Netherlands Government (SEF) and Canadian Red Cross Society/Canadian Government (DFATD).|MDRID010
4301|The unspent balance of CHF 42,871 will be returned to the DREF pot.|MDRID010
4314|A 6.4 magnitude earthquake struck off Pidie Jaya District, province of Aceh in Sumatra Island, Indonesia, around 05:00 local time, on Wednesday 7 December 2016.|MDRID011
4315|The national disaster management agency’s (BNPB) and the regional disaster management agency (BPBD) coordinated the response and reported that at least 104 people lost their lives and more than 11,378 houses, including shops, office building, schools, mosques and hospitals, were damaged.|MDRID011
4316|A total of 85,161 people were affected, with 857 injured.|MDRID011
4317|There was also damage to roads, hampering access to some of the affected areas.|MDRID011
4318|Water sources were damaged and people had to depend on water distribution for some time.|MDRID011
4319|Health institutions were not spared.|MDRID011
4320|According to the US Geological Survey (USGS), the quake was centred 17 kilometres northeast of Pidie Jaya – around 121 km southeast of Banda Aceh – with a depth of 10 km.|MDRID011
4329|On 22 September 2017, Indonesian Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation Centre (Pusat Vulkanologi dan Mitigasi Bencana Geologi Indonesia – PVMBG) raised the Alert Level of Mount Agung in Bali from Level III (High Alert: Orange/Ready to Erupt) to the highest: Level IV (Red Alert/Danger).|MDRID012
4330|This triggered a mass evacuation of villages living near the volcano.|MDRID012
4331|By 29 September 2017, the number of evacuees was over 143,000 people in 471 camps.|MDRID012
4332|A month later, the Alert Level was downgraded from Level IV to Level III, reducing the number of evacuees to 133,349 people in 383 camps.|MDRID012
4333|The Alert Level was raised again to Level IV on 27 November 2017, correspondingly widening the exclusion zone to 10km from the crater.|MDRID012
4334|The Alert Level has been lowered to Level III since 10 February 2018 and remains in place as this report was finalized.|MDRID012
4335|Dozens of mild magmatic and phreatic eruptions have been recorded since then, with the last recorded activity on 26 January 2018.|MDRID012
4336|PVMBG stated that there was a drastic drop in volcanic activity in January 2018 compared to December 2017.|MDRID012
4337|According to seismic data collection, approximately 50 shallow earthquakes were recorded per day in December.|MDRID012
4338|This went down to about 10 per day towards the beginning of January, and then reduced to 4 per day.|MDRID012
4339|The last recorded eruption was on 23 January.|MDRID012
4340|There were a few low to mild eruptions recorded by the end of February 2018.|MDRID012
4341|Geographically, there are 22 villages located in the disaster-prone areas with a total population of 239,231 people.|MDRID012
4342|Given the prolonged duration of the emergency and with the instruction of the head of the district, the exclusion zone was reduced to 6km and may likely be reduced even further.|MDRID012
4343|The number of evacuees has also declined.|MDRID012
4344|By 26 February 2018, official records reported a total of 1,791 evacuees in 41 evacuation sites in Karangasem district.|MDRID012
4345|While the Alert Level remains the same at Level III, there is a significant risk of eruption.|MDRID012
4346|This risk still requires mitigation by PMI and the authorities through Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) activities, and/or preparations for the safe return of evacuees.|MDRID012
4444|Staring the last week of July and into early August, heavy rainfall across western, northern, central and eastern India resulted in extensive flooding and displacement of people.|MDRIN015
4445|Due to this flooding more than 293 people died across the affected states, with one million people sheltered in the relief camps established by government and humanitarian agencies.|MDRIN015
4446|Over 13.7 million people were affected by the floods.|MDRIN015
4447|The most affected states include Assam, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Odisha, Rajasthan and West Bengal.|MDRIN015
4448|As other local and national authorities and a small number of other organizations ensured provision of the emergency food and relief items, IRCS focus was on delivering emergency shelter, safe drinking water and hygiene promotion in Assam, Gujarat, West Bengal and Manipur of 8,000 flood affected families (40,000 people).|MDRIN015
4472|A severe depression formed over the Bay of Bengal in early November 2015 was followed by heavy rains in several parts of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.|MDRIN016
4473|The rains intensified in early December 2015 again and caused unprecedented rains and flooding pounding several parts of Chennai city and most areas of its suburbs, leaving over 300 people dead and prompting government to declare it a “calamity of severe nature”.|MDRIN016
4474|Chennai Corporation officials reported at least 57,000 houses in the city of Chennai suffered structural damages.|MDRIN016
4475|The city was badly affected with more than a million people directly affected by flash floods and overflows from lakes and reservoirs.|MDRIN016
4476|During the first week of December, Chennai received 539 mm of rain which is above the normally recorded monthly average of 191 mm.|MDRIN016

4497|The monsoon rains progressed most of parts of India since July 2016, with some parts of India mainly Assam, Bihar, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Uttara Pradesh and Uttarakhand received excessive rainfall.|MDRIN017
4498|Around 1.7 million people were affected due to monsoon rainfall in 2016 – Assam and Bihar have been severely affected.|MDRIN017
4499|Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) with support and coordination of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), army and civil administrations, evacuated people affected by floods to safer locations, established camps for relief distributions, provided food and non-food items to the affected people.|MDRIN017
4500|Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS) has activated its First Medical Responders (FMR)1, trained to respond to such situations all across the affected areas.|MDRIN017
4501|During the first two weeks of the floods, it was difficult to reach the affected people due to standing floodwaters.|MDRIN017
4502|They coordinated with NDRF, SDRF and army in relief and rescue operations.|MDRIN017
4503|FMR volunteers provided first aid to the affected.|MDRIN017
4504|IRCS national headquarters (NHQ), responding to the request from the Assam state branch immediately released 500 family packs2 and requested IFRC for support through Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to support a total of 5,000 families affected by floods in Assam that included the 500 family packs released immediately after the disaster.|MDRIN017
4539|From early July 2017, heavy monsoon rains and floods were reported across the north-east part of India, especially in the states of Assam and Manipur.|MDRIN018
4540|These states were affected by three rounds of floods, with sporadic rainfall and raised flood water levels continuing until early September.|MDRIN018
4541|Assam is prone to floods and erosions every year due to monsoon rainfall in the state and its neighboring states, with its two main rivers Brahmaputra and Barak and their numerous tributaries and sub-tributaries flooding during the monsoon season.|MDRIN018
4542|However, the deluge this year was one of the worst in 29 years.|MDRIN018
4543|According to Assam’s State Disaster Management Authority, as of July 2017, 75 people were killed and approximately 1.7 million people affected in 24 districts of the state (with 12 districts being the worst affected) as a result of flooding.|MDRIN018
4544|Infrastructure was damaged and roads and bridges submerged, disrupting surface communication.|MDRIN018
4545|Almost 75 per cent of Kaziranga National Park, a world heritage site, was inundated.|MDRIN018
4546|In Manipur, the rains that started after cyclone Mora during the last week of May 2017 caused floods across many parts of the state.|MDRIN018
4547|Like in Assam, in Manipur too the flood levels this year were above normal and were referred to as once in a 30-year event by media reports.|MDRIN018
4548|According to Manipur’s State Department of Relief and Disaster Management, four districts were affected, with many low-lying areas in and around Imphal, the capital of Manipur, inundated by flood waters.|MDRIN018
4549|The road network was cut off at many places due to landslides.|MDRIN018
4550|Flood waters remained in many low-lying areas, increasing vulnerability to water borne diseases.|MDRIN018
4551|Large scale crops were lost affecting agriculture, which is the primary source of people’s livelihood in the state Relief materials were dispatched to both Assam and Manipur from IRCS’ regional warehouses, following initial delays caused by damaged roads and railway tracks.|MDRIN018
4552|Transporting material using trucks was a challenge during the monsoon season, especially for Manipur, as all goods needed to be transported via Guwahati, the capital of Assam.|MDRIN018
4553|A joint rapid needs assessment was conducted by Sphere India and the assessed needs aligned closely with the strategy and activities of the DREF operation.|MDRIN018
4554|However, the needs in Assam were much more than what could be covered under the DREF operation.|MDRIN018
4555|The IRCS therefore launched a domestic appeal to support its longer-term relief and recovery plan, which sought to scale up the assistance to all flood affected states in India, including Assam and Manipur.|MDRIN018
4578|During the monsoon season from June to September 2017, the intensity of rains leading to floods impacted millions of people across the northern part of India.|MDRIN019
4579|The states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal were the worst affected.|MDRIN019
4580|Although floods are common in the northern part of the country, heavy rainfall and floods in Nepal worsened the situation resulting in flooding across the three states.|MDRIN019
4581|According to media reports, 13 million people were affected in Bihar alone, with deaths mounting to approximately 500.|MDRIN019
4582|Unofficial reports indicated many more deaths.|MDRIN019
4583|Although the damages in Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal were comparatively less, floods affected these states too, disrupting normal life and causing heavy damages to infrastructure and livelihoods.|MDRIN019
4584|People living along the low-lying areas were the worst affected, whose houses were either fully destroyed or damaged.|MDRIN019
4585|Flood waters washed away household items leaving thousands of people in need of immediate relief support.|MDRIN019
4586|It is important to note that the geographical area affected by the floods in 2017 was more than the area affected by the Kosi river floods a few years back, which displaced thousands of people overnight in 21 districts across Bihar.|MDRIN019
4653|On 12 November, a 7.3 magnitude earthquake hit the northern border region between Iran and Iraq.|MDRIQ009

4670|On 27 September 2016, Tropical Storm Matthew began gaining strength in the Caribbean; by September 28, the storm’s wind speeds had reached 60 mph (95 km / h), prompting the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)’s National Hurricane Centre (NHC) to post an advisory on Tropical Storm Matthew at 15:00 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) that day on its website.|MDRJM004
4671|Within hours of the advisory, Matthew had moved toward Saint Lucia and entered the Caribbean Sea.|MDRJM004
4672|The following day, it veered south-west and became a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with maximum sustained wind speeds at or exceeding 74 mph (119 km/h).|MDRJM004
4673|On 30 September 2016, Hurricane Matthew became the most powerful hurricane of the 2016 Atlantic hurricane season, when it reached Category 4 hurricane status, with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h).|MDRJM004
4674|On 1 October 2016, Matthew briefly became a Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds at or exceeding 157 mph (253 km/h) before winds speeds decreased and returned to the Category 4 level.|MDRJM004
4675|On October 3, 2016, the centre of Hurricane Matthew was located near latitude 17.8 degrees North, Longitude 74.4 degrees West.|MDRJM004
4676|Matthew moved toward the North near 15 km/h (9 mph).|MDRJM004
4677|Maximum sustained winds were near 230 km/h (145 mph), with higher gusts, maintaining a Category 4 status on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.|MDRJM004
4678|Hurricane force winds extended outward up to 65 km (40 miles) from the centre and tropical storm-force winds extend outward up to 295 km (185 miles).|MDRJM004
4679|Matthew continued a northward trajectory which kept Jamaica outside of the range of the hurricane-force winds; however, the risk of tropical-force winds spreading over eastern parishes remained, necessitating the issuing of a Tropical Storm Warning for the island.|MDRJM004
4680|On October 4, 2016 at 10:00 am, the Meteorological Service of Jamaica discontinued the Tropical Storm Warning for Jamaica.|MDRJM004
4681|The island was no longer threatened by Tropical Storm-force winds as hurricane Matthew continued to move away and weather conditions improved.|MDRJM004
4682|The centre of Hurricane Matthew was located near latitude 18.9 degrees North, Longitude 74.3 degrees West.|MDRJM004
4683|This was about 230 kilometres (140 miles) east of Morant Point or 60 Kilometres (35 miles) east of Tiburon, Haiti.|MDRJM004
4684|The National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC) at the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM) received reports of roads being blocked because of rock fall and landslides in the parishes of Saint.|MDRJM004

5173|During the night on 17-18 November, several aftershocks followed.|MDRKG011
5174|According to the Ministry of Emergency Situations (MoES) of the Kyrgyz Republic, no human casualties occurred, but different levels of damage were sustained by houses, education facilities, mosques, community centers, health posts, and other infrastructure.|MDRKG011
5175|The total number of affected communities in the six districts reached 39.|MDRKG011
5176|The number of the affected residents exceeded 15,000 people (which is about 3,300 families).|MDRKG011
5177|Over 200 families were reported to have lost their houses while over 800 houses were reported to have been severely damaged2.|MDRKG011
5178|The Red Crescent Society of Kyrgyzstan deployed its experienced disaster response staff and volunteers to support the local authorities and the MoES in rapid assessments and was in the process of organizing emergency items distributions in the affected areas.|MDRKG011
5179|The MoES set up tents in the worst-affected communities (Chaichi village of Kara-Suu District) and attended to the immediate needs of the population.|MDRKG011
5180|The affected residents were in need of emergency shelter, warm clothes and other essential household items.|MDRKG011
5198|On 3 May 2017, a 5.9 magnitude earthquake with a depth of 10 km occurred in northern Tajikistan near the border of Kyrgyzstan.|MDRKG012
5199|The epicenter of the earthquake was 120 km away from Batken and 192 km from Osh city in southern Kyrgyzstan.|MDRKG012
5200|Several aftershocks occurred the following days; a 5.8 earthquake, likewise with a depth of 10 km, was registered on 5 May in the same area.|MDRKG012
5201|While there were no fatalities in Kyrgyzstan, the earthquakes severely damaged infrastructure, including educational and health facilities, as well as houses in the Chong Alay District of the Osh Province and in the Kadamjai District of the Batken Province.|MDRKG012
5202|On 5 May 2017, the second earthquake hit the same area, increasing the number of harmed people and damaged facilities.|MDRKG012
5203|Afterwards, RCSK deployed its National Disaster Response Team (NDRT) members from its Osh Branch to the scene.|MDRKG012
5204|The team was deployed within 72 hours following the second earthquake and initiated emergency needs assessment (ENA) with provision of psychological first aid to the affected families, as well as the identification of priority needs and gaps.|MDRKG012
5205|According to the data provided by MoES and local municipalities, five villages of the Chong Alay District of Osh province (Karamyk, Jekendi, Kara-Teyit, Chuluk and Shibee) sustained major damages.|MDRKG012
5206|1,000 families (roughly 5,000 people) were reported to have been affected in these villages as of 8 May 2017, with 237 families whose houses were severely damaged (Cat III) and 537 families with partially or completely destroyed houses (Cat IV and Cat V).|MDRKG012
5207|The earthquake caused damage in local infrastructure objects – (three local clinics, one school and one mosque) and loss of livestock (100 goats/sheep).|MDRKG012
5208|To address the needs of population in emergency shelter, MoES distributed 550 summer tents.|MDRKG012
5209|On 8 May 2017, the RCSK Osh branch team was deployed to Chong Alay District to conduct emergency needs assessments (ENA) in five worst-affected villages.|MDRKG012
5210|In order to organise a more effective and harmonised response, RCSK conducted analysis of primary data (household interviews, focus group discussions (community leaders, local traders, etc.) and available secondary data (status reports from Chong Alay district administration and situational reports and updates of local MoES representatives).|MDRKG012
5277|Madagascar regularly experiences seasonal outbreaks of bubonic plague and the outbreaks normally extend from August to April each year.|MDRKM006
5278|In 2017 however, the first cases of person to person transmission via pneumonic plague occurred.|MDRKM006
5279|The first death of a patient infected with the plague was notified on 27 August 2017.|MDRKM006
5280|Plague cases were reported in 20 districts across Madagascar as of 3 October, with the cumulative number of cases reported by this date being 194 with 50 deaths (case fatality rate 15.5)1 recorded, 124 of the cases were recorded as pneumonic transmission.|MDRKM006
5281|The occurrence of pneumonic transmission in urban areas posed the risk of substantial spread and high caseload required urgent and comprehensive response to save lives.|MDRKM006
5282|Specimens from suspected cases were submitted to the Institute Pasteur de Madagascar and confirmed cases were identified by either polymerase chain reaction or rapid diagnostic tests.|MDRKM006
5283|Antananarivo was one of the most affected areas, followed by the port city of Toamasina, and the rural district of Faratsiho.|MDRKM006
5284|Of the total deaths from the plague, one was a foreigner who was visiting Madagascar and at least 8 health care workers were infected.|MDRKM006
5285|Plague can be a very severe disease in people, particularly in its septicaemic and pneumonic forms, with a case-fatality ratio of 30%-100% if left untreated.|MDRKM006
5286|The pneumonic form is invariably fatal unless treated early, is especially contagious and can trigger severe epidemics through person-to-person contact via droplets in the air.|MDRKM006
5287|Untreated pneumonic plague can be rapidly fatal, so early diagnosis, referral and treatment is essential for survival and reduction of transmission and complications.|MDRKM006
5288|Antibiotics and supportive therapy are effective against plague if patients are diagnosed in time.|MDRKM006
5289|Pneumonic plague can be fatal within 18 to 24 hours of disease onset if left untreated.|MDRKM006
5290|Based on the Epidemiological modeling done for the outbreak in Madagascar the following could happen:|MDRKM006
5291|The above projections were however on the lower side because the total number of new cases reported after the modeling (issued on 6 October 2017) showed that within 1 week, the number of plague cases had reached nearly half of the projected estimates for a three week period i.e. 6 Oct (231 cases, 33 deaths, CFR 14.3%), on 30 September 2018 (133 cases, 24 deaths, CFR 18.0%).|MDRKM006
5292|Based on number of new cases reported it was projected that the total number of cases over 24 days will be 960 against the projected 219 and 577 in the modelling.|MDRKM006
5293|It was also noted that the recent cases were without an apparent epidemiological link to the index case (WHO Response Plan).|MDRKM006
5294|This implied multiple separate outbreaks, aerosolized transmission (as compared to persons-to-person), or that existing contact tracing remained incomplete, thereby further supporting the assumption of a case identification lag.|MDRKM006
5295|There was moderate risk that the outbreak could be a regional outbreak with Seychelles already having one confirmed case of its citizen who travelled from Madagascar as well as another citizen who died from the plague in Madagascar.|MDRKM006
5296|As there is regular travel and contact between the Comoros Islands and Madagascar with approximately 350 people traveling from Madagascar into Comoros per week, there was a potential that the plague may be imported into the Comoros and therefore there was a need to prepare the Comoros Red Crescent Society to respond to the epidemic.|MDRKM006
5297|The Comoros RC Society (CRCo) received a DREF grant of CHF 67,937 for preparedness on plague for community surveillance for 204,821 (25% of the caseload) people at risk through provision of training of volunteers on the plague, mass awareness and community engagement and accountability activities.|MDRKM006
5298|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), AECID, the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRKM006
5299|On behalf of the Comoros Red Crescent Society (CRCo), the IFRC would like to extend its gratitude to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRKM006
5317|Between 1 and 5 August 2015, torrential rains have caused floods in several Ri-s (villages) and in the outskirts of cities of south Hwanghae and north and south Hamgyong provinces of Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK).|MDRKP007
5318|According to the State Committee on Emergency and Disaster Management (SCEDM), the Government of DPRK and the DPRK Red Cross Society (RCS), the floods affected 3,541 people, claimed 24 lives and 9 people are reported missing in more than 20 affected cities/counties.|MDRKP007
5319|The floods have destroyed 714 houses and further damaged 276 houses.|MDRKP007
5320|In addition, 4,011 hectares of crops, 4,930 m2 of roads, 632 m of bridges, 1,976 m2 of railway tracks and 5 km of water supply canals were damaged by the floods.|MDRKP007
5321|Hard on the heels of severe drought (reportedly the worst in a century) impacted dry rivers, estuaries, canals could not drain the huge volume of water and overflowed causing floods in settlements, cultivated areas and the destruction of properties and infrastructure.|MDRKP007
5322|During the third quarter of the August, the country experienced a second round of flooding following Typhoon Goni.|MDRKP007
5323|Although the country was not directly hit by the typhoon, many parts of the country were affected by heavy rainfall and flash floods brought by the system on 22 and 23 August.|MDRKP007
5324|The greatest impact was felt in the northeastern city of Rason, near the border of Russia and China.|MDRKP007
5325|In two different major floods occurred during the first and fourth week of August, in 2015, DPRK received more than half of its annual average rainfall(321mm) causing wide spread damage and loss to lives, properties and belongings.|MDRKP007
5326|According to UNOCHA snapshot information, approximately 22,000 were affected, 14,500 people were displaced, 118 people confirmed dead, and 6,473 houses were either destroyed or partly damaged, 5,399 families had lost access to safe drinking water and 125 hectares of farmland and at least 375 MT of crops were lost in Rason area.|MDRKP007
5335|On 22 January 2018, the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH), DPR Korea reported a total of 126,574 influenza like illness (ILI) cases for the period from 1 December 2017 to 16 January 2018.|MDRKP009
5336|Of the reported ILI cases, 81,640 were positive for influenza|MDRKP009
5337|A (H1N1) pdm 091.|MDRKP009
5338|Due to the severe cold winter in December, there was an upsurge of ILI cases.|MDRKP009
5339|Therefore, MoPH collected 3,408 samples randomly from some of the ILI/SARI sentinel surveillance sites in the national influenza surveillance network.|MDRKP009
5340|Of these samples, 2,198 (65 per cent) were found to be positive for influenza|MDRKP009
5341|A (H1N1) pdm09.|MDRKP009
5342|Subsequently, the MoPH provided the age distribution of the 126,574 ILI cases.|MDRKP009
5343|During the week from 17-23 January, MOPH reported another 51,685 ILI cases of which 28,375 were positive for influenza|MDRKP009
5344|A /H1N1pdm09.|MDRKP009
5345|From 1 December 2017 to 23 January 2018, there were a cumulative total of 178,259 ILI cases and 110,015 laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A/H1N1 pdm 09.|MDRKP009
5346|There were four reported deaths attributable to ILI.|MDRKP009
5347|The reported case fatality rate was 0.002 per cent.|MDRKP009
5348|Among these deaths, three were children under 5 years of age and one was an adult.|MDRKP009
5349|On 24 January 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) convened the health sector working group meeting where partner United Nations and other international agencies including the IFRC were appraised of the situation and requested for participation in containing the situation specially in the conducting of public health education campaigns.|MDRKP009
5350|By this time the outbreak of influenza has been wide-spread in the country for more than a period of one month hence the deployment of seasonal influenza vaccines to prevent the outbreak was deemed by WHO to have a very limited role.|MDRKP009
5351|Proper case management with a view to preventing complications and mortality was the priority action.|MDRKP009
5352|The identification of cases of ILI at the early stage with a focus on severe cases and high-risk groups including pregnant and lactating women, children under 5 years, the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions and their referral to hospitals for optimal management inclusive of administration of antiviral drugs was of vital importance.|MDRKP009
5353|These highrisk populations were to have priority access to Oseltamivir2.|MDRKP009
5354|In view of ongoing severe winter, health workers dealing with ILI patients needed to be protected against transmission of the illness.|MDRKP009
5355|It is important to recognize that one of the major factors underpinning the rapid spread of the outbreak was the diminished capacity of the public sector to control it due to a severe lack of pharmaceuticals, consumables and personal protective equipment (PPE).|MDRKP009
5356|As the severely cold winter with temperature of -20 to -30°C persisted in February and March, there was a fear that the occurrence of ILI cases would be protracted.|MDRKP009
5357|WHO emphasized the need with MoPH and international partners for implementing non-pharmaceutical public health measures through a public education campaign.|MDRKP009
5358|These non-pharmaceutical public health measures included messages on washing hands frequently, adhering to cough etiquette (covering cough or sneeze) and cleaning surfaces touched by numerous people, particularly in public areas.|MDRKP009
5452|A sudden rise of temperature in central and eastern Kazakhstan resulted in the fast melting of snow that caused floods on 8-9 April 2015.|MDRKZ008
5453|A state of emergency was declared in the regions of Akmola, Karaganda and Pavlodar, with more than 50 settlements affected.|MDRKZ008
5454|Road infrastructure including bridges were damaged, livestock killed and electricity and water supplies disrupted.|MDRKZ008
5455|In Karaganda region alone, five districts were affected: more than 1,700 houses in 35 settlements were flooded with the total number of affected people making 12,670.|MDRKZ008
5456|Over 11,000 people were evacuated from their homes, two senior citizens died.|MDRKZ008
5457|Several evacuated people were housed in schools, hotels, hostels and mosques but most of them found shelter with their relatives.|MDRKZ008
5458|At the end of April, people started getting back to their homes in the affected areas.|MDRKZ008
5459|According to the results of the further government assessment in Karaganda region, 2,107 families were affected, 449 houses were found unfit for habitation, out of them 148 in the most hit G. Mustafin settlement.|MDRKZ008
5460|The construction of new houses started in May and was completed in October, with the first houses finished in the beginning of June.|MDRKZ008
5461|The water drew back from the flooded territories at the beginning of May.|MDRKZ008
5462|This allowed the National Society to carry out a detailed needs assessment in the most affected areas.|MDRKZ008
5463|Based on the results of the needs assessment, the Red Crescent Society revised the operational plan: additional relief items (kitchen utensils) were included in the distribution plan at the expense of bed linen sets, the number of which was reduced.|MDRKZ008
5480|Heavy rains, which started pouring on 11 August 2016 and continued to 20 August 2016, caused flooding in five provinces of the Lao People’s Republic.|MDRLA004
5481|Initially, rains affected the provinces of Luang Prabang, Oudomxay, Saravan and Sayabouri on 11 to 18 August.|MDRLA004
5482|As conditions began to improve, a week later there followed more rains fuelled by effects of Tropical Strom Dianmu, mainly affecting the province of Xiangkhouang.|MDRLA004
5483|According to information consolidated by the Lao Red Cross (LRC), five casualties were reported, with at least 26,328 people affected across five provinces.|MDRLA004
5484|Specifically, the number of people affected per province is 3,375 in Luangprabang, 19,242 in Oudomxay, 2,760 in Salavan, 891 in Xaignabouli and 60 in Xiangkhouang.|MDRLA004
5485|The largest number of affected population was in Oudomxay Province.|MDRLA004
5486|A joint assessment convened by the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare and involving other ministries – conducted in the province of Oudomxay and whose report was issued on 29 August 2016 – confirmed the relevance of the LRC geographic targeting, i.e. the most affected area.|MDRLA004
5487|Following the assessment, the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare recommended the release of emergency fund for the province (LAK 200 million or equivalent of CHF 23,600).|MDRLA004
5500|The snow storm that hit Lebanon on the 6th of January 2015 caused extensive damage to communities as well as infrastructures.|MDRLB005
5501|The Lebanese Red Cross (LRC) started its operations and responded from day one of the disaster by evacuating 1,919 to a safer location after temperatures went extremely low and people were affected by gas and heat suffocation.|MDRLB005
5502|Some weeks after the first storm, on the 10th and 17th of February two successive major storms hit the country severely damaging roads, coastal roads, marine and infrastructures.|MDRLB005
5503|The LRC remobilized its resources 60 jeeps and 40 ambulances and was on high alert to respond to the needs of around 942 affected people.|MDRLB005
5563|On 27 September 2016, an area of inclement weather in the Atlantic Ocean began to gather speed, reaching speeds of 60 mph (96 km/h); by 11:00am Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) that same day, authorities in St Lucia issued a Tropical Storm Warning as the system had been upgraded to Tropical Storm Matthew, and it was expected to impact the island.|MDRLC003
5564|Within hours of the warning, residents began to experience heavy rainfall and strong winds of up to 60 mph or higher associated with the approaching storm.|MDRLC003
5565|At 5:00pm EDT on 28 September 2016, Tropical Storm Matthew’s Centre was located near latitude 13.N and 62.0W or about 65 miles west of St Lucia.|MDRLC003
5566|Heavy rainfall, rough seas and strong gusty winds associated with Tropical Storm Mathew continued to impact the island until 8:00am on 29 September 2016.|MDRLC003
5567|Early reports from the National District Disaster Committees, Saint Lucia Red Cross (SLRC) volunteers and CDRTs indicated that there were power outages in several communities across the island and that all Saint Lucia’s quadrants including Gros Islet, Castries, Bexon, Marc, Dennery, Laborie, Micoud, Choisuel and Vieux Fort were flooded; the storm’s passage also resulted in the loss services such as telephone and internet, impassable roads, the loss of the water supply in some areas, roofing damage in a number of areas and flooding and damage to primary health care facilities’ roofing.|MDRLC003
5568|Based on initial rapid assessments conducted by the Saint Lucia Red Cross, at least 250 families were affected by the flooding and damaged roofs.|MDRLC003
5569|The immediate needs of those affected included blankets, clean and tarpaulins; additionally, the National Emergency Management Office (identified damage to farms through its assessment.|MDRLC003
5570|Following the tropical storm’s passage, the national water agency Water and Sewerage Company Limited (WASCO) and St. Lucia Electricity Services Limited (LUCELEC) worked to restore the supply of water and electricity.|MDRLC003
5578|Sri Lanka faced an unpredicted outbreak of dengue fever.|MDRLK007
5579|It is a tropical country with two monsoon seasons.|MDRLK007
5580|With each monsoon brings in two peaks of dengue fever making it an endemic disease in Sri Lanka.|MDRLK007
5581|However, 2017 started with an exceptionally high number of dengue cases which shot up to an outbreak in May-June 2017, creating the largest dengue outbreak experienced by the country for last three decades.|MDRLK007
5582|During the year 2017 a total of 186,101 suspected dengue cases were reported and as of 24 May 2018 a total of 19,459 suspected dengue cases were reported to the Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health (MoH) of Sri Lanka with over 320 deaths in 2017 and 202 deaths in 2018.|MDRLK007
5583|Over 40 per cent of dengue cases were reported from the Western province.|MDRLK007
5584|The highest numbers of dengue cases were reported during the 29th week of 2017.|MDRLK007
5585|All four virus types of dengue have been seen in Sri Lanka.|MDRLK007
5586|The outbreak was predominantly due to Dengue Fever Virus Type 2 (DEN-2), which was not the usual type circulating in Sri Lanka.|MDRLK007
5587|According to the WHO, this is a 4.3-foldhigher than the average number of cases for the same period between 2010 and 2016.|MDRLK007
5588|Monthly reported dengue cases are varied depending on the rains received.|MDRLK007
5589|In July 2017 the highest number of dengue cases were reported where 22 per cent of the total dengue cases reported.|MDRLK007
5590|Historical data shows that there were always two peaks of dengue incidence in Sri Lanka.|MDRLK007
5591|One during Southwest monsoons and another during Northeast monsoons.|MDRLK007
5592|Analysis of the data on the present outbreak showed the incidence of dengue were high in eastern province and districts adjoining to western province.|MDRLK007
5593|Especially with the commencement of the North-Eastern monsoons, there was a risk of Dengue outbreaks in more districts.|MDRLK007
5594|The MoH requested from SLRCS with a second letter dated 11 September 2017 to scale up the activities at community level.|MDRLK007
5595|Since the schools have been considered as a hot spot for dengue in Sri Lanka and were closed in the month of December.|MDRLK007
5596|Considering there was trend of outbreak in January and February, SLRCS requested for two-month extension till 28 February 2018, to allow sufficient time to complete the school awareness activities and to conduct public awareness public education (PAPE) on Dengue prevention via mainstream media.|MDRLK007
5597|Furthermore, for the sustainability of the program, dengue activities were incorporated to ongoing flood operations and operation plan activities.|MDRLK007
5610|The southwest monsoon weather conditions caused rainfalls since 19 May 2018 in the southwest parts of the island.|MDRLK008
5611|By 21 May 2018, the precipitation triggered a flood and landslide situation in the country, which affected thousands of lives and livelihoods, as well as caused property damage.|MDRLK008
5612|According to a situation update issued on 26 May 2018 by the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) of Sri Lanka, around 153,712 people in 19 districts were affected and 20 people killed due to heavy rains, strong winds, lightning and landslides.|MDRLK008

5632|From the assessment and on-site verification of the situation, over 10,000 people were rendered homeless by the floods.|MDRLR002
5633|Water sources were contaminated, makeshift latrines collapsed in the wake of pre-existing health sector weaknesses worsened by the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD).|MDRLR002
5634|The flood-affected population was staying in public buildings (churches, mosques and schools) with limited access to sanitation, which resulted into a high risk of water-borne infections.|MDRLR002
5635|The floods caused damage to crops (vegetables and root crops), poor access to shelter and loss of Essential Household Items (EHIs) and food.|MDRLR002
5636|Regular assessments were conducted to collect data and review operational modalities and evolving needs.|MDRLR002
5663|On 10 October 2017, Liberia had the task of organising the first election run and managed by Liberians since the end of the 14 years of Civil War in 2003.|MDRLR003
5664|As Liberia had never, before these elections, witnessed a smooth transition of democratic governance from one president to another, the Liberian National Red Cross Society requested for support from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)’s Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) for an Elections Preparedness and Response operations, given the country’s history with elections.|MDRLR003
5665|On 1 September 2017, the DREF granted CHF 85,027 to support Liberia National Red Cross Society (LNRCS) in training and mobilizing volunteers for their deployment in response to potential violence during the 2017 elections.|MDRLR003
5666|Indeed, Liberians went to the polls on 10 October 2017.|MDRLR003

5673|On Thursday, 30 November 2017, the Supreme Court handed down a ruling into complaints of election fraud and massive irregularities filed by the Liberty Party.|MDRLR003
5674|According to the Court, the Liberty Party and its collaborators did not have sufficient evidence to warrant stopping the run-off elections as they proposed to do.|MDRLR003
5675|The Court ruled that run-off elections duly take place in line with the electoral laws and the Constitution of Liberia.|MDRLR003
5676|Several prescriptions were mandated by the Court including the total clean-up of the voters roll among many things.|MDRLR003
5677|The NEC announced the final date for Run-off election between the Unity Party and the Congress for Democratic Change (CDC) to be on 26 December 2017.|MDRLR003
5678|This pronouncement created a huge debate in the political environment of the country.|MDRLR003
5679|The ruling Unity party filed a bill of information to the Supreme Court asking for the removal of the Head of NEC and the suspension of the scheduled run-off on December 26.|MDRLR003
5680|After the first round of the elections, the LNRCS requested for a one month timeframe extension, which led to the revision of the timeframe (see Operations Update No 1) to allow volunteer presence on the ground until elections were completed as pre and post elections violence were anticipated.|MDRLR003
5681|In all, this DREF operation lasted 4 months, from 01 September to 31 December 2017.|MDRLR003
5682|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), AECID, the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRLR003
5683|The IFRC, on behalf of the Liberia National Red Cross Society, would like to extend many thanks to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRLR003
5695|In September 2017, continuous torrential rains during the third to fourth week left 42 communities inundated with water in Lower Margibi and Montserrado Counties of Liberia.|MDRLR004
5696|According to rapid assessments by the local Red Cross branch and the office of the City Mayor of Unification City along with local communities leaders, 21 villages/communities and close to 10,000 people or 2,000 families had been affected by the rainfall.|MDRLR004
5697|Around 1,500 families homes and livelihood security were affected by the floods.|MDRLR004
5698|Water sources were contaminated as a result of the floods in the vulnerable communities.|MDRLR004
5699|Flooded latrines, factories, graves and water sources put the community at risk of water and vector borne diseases.|MDRLR004
5700|Liberia is amongst the world’s wettest countries and has had a record number of floods in the last ten years.|MDRLR004
5701|Lower Margibi has a history of recurring floods in the last four years where communities remain at risk of flooding especially during the peak of the rainy season.|MDRLR004
5702|This recurring flood tendency was flagged in late June and early July 2016 in a report of the National Disaster Management Agency which reported that over 15,000 persons were affected by floods in 49 communities of Lower Margibi.|MDRLR004
5703|In Montserrado, urban communities are among the most affected with over 45% of the population being affected.|MDRLR004
5704|Still in September 2017, the Du River joining the Atlantic Ocean in Lower Margibi overflowed its banks thereby leaving people in their communities at risk.|MDRLR004
5705|The main road to the International Airport was rendered impassable due to the flood waters, heavily constraining vehicle traffic and those travelling by air as road traffic had to find alternative routes.|MDRLR004
5706|These rains hampered ability of those marooned in their villages to both leave and return safely.|MDRLR004
5707|Following these events, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) approved a DREF allocation of CHF127,086 in October 2017, for floods affected communities in Montserrado and Margibi Counties in Liberia.|MDRLR004
5708|The DREF operation aimed at providing recovery support to over 2,000 persons affected by the 2017 September floods disaster in these Counties.|MDRLR004
5709|The timely implementation of the DREF operation was challenged by the Liberia Representative and Presidential elections in October 2017.|MDRLR004
5710|As the LNRCS was heavily engaged with preparedness and response to the elections.|MDRLR004
5711|500 volunteers were mobilized for this operation, thus leaving the implementation of planned actions under the DREF to be delayed.|MDRLR004
5712|In addition, relief items were delivered in-country only in January 2018 as more than 60% of relief items distributed in this operation were procured through the IFRC system.|MDRLR004
5713|This also caused some delay to implementation of activities, leading to the operation timeframe to be extended for an additional one month.|MDRLR004
5714|Operation Update 1 was thus published in December 2017 to materialize this timeframe extension.|MDRLR004
5715|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), AECID, the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRLR004
5716|The IFRC, on behalf of the Liberia National Red Cross Society, would like to extend many thanks to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRLR004
5759|Morocco was affected by a cold wave on Saturday the 27th of February 2016, this wave caused by a polar air mass flow passing from the North Pole to Europe and North Africa generated westerly winds accompanied with extreme and low temperatures.|MDRMA007
5760|The regions of the Middle Atlas and the north of the High Atlas and the neighbouring plains witnessed severe thunderstorms, while significant snow fell over the High and Middle Atlas, the Rif and the highlands of eastern Morocco.|MDRMA007
5761|This precipitation was accompanied by moderate to strong winds, and temperatures that dropped significantly, reaching exceptionally low records, particularly in the interior regions of the country and the Atlas Mountains.|MDRMA007
5762|The wave caused economic losses and isolation for several areas in Morocco, the electricity was interrupted as well and houses suffered from structural damages and water supply interruption due to the freezing temperatures.|MDRMA007
5781|In mid-January 2017, a cold wave moved across Morocco affecting most cities.|MDRMA008
5782|Temperatures fell rapidly, reaching as low as minus 13 degrees Celsius in high altitude areas, and between minus two and zero degree Celsius in the centre of the country.|MDRMA008
5783|This wave of freezing air and snow caused economic and livelihood losses in several isolated areas.|MDRMA008
5784|In addition, traffic was paralyzed as well because of inaccessible roads which reduced supplies to certain remote communities.|MDRMA008
5785|The Ministry of Equipment, Transport and Logistics was mobilized to access those areas.|MDRMA008
5786|In addition to roads and mountain passages blocked by snowfalls, some houses suffered from structural damages and power outages.|MDRMA008
5787|Due to low temperatures, the water pipes froze and interrupted the water supply in many areas.|MDRMA008
5788|Most parts of the Kingdom felt the impact of this unusual cold wave.|MDRMA008
5789|Facing this situation, local authorities and relevant services mobilized all the human and material resources, and activated crisis management cells to help the most affected populations.|MDRMA008
5790|As an auxiliary of the public authorities in the humanitarian actions, and following the example of the previous crises, Moroccan Red Crescent was engaged by the authorities to help the affected population.|MDRMA008
5791|As part of the coordination group with the Ministry of the Interior, Moroccan Red Crescent was commissioned to intervene in three regions to help 2,000 families (10,000 beneficiaries) to provide food and non-food relief items.|MDRMA008
5792|These regions are: Oriental, Tangier-Tetouan and Fes-Taza.|MDRMA008
5793|The table below illustrates the areas and distances involved :|MDRMA008
5854|In August 2017 the so called “Adriatic route” opened, and since then there has been a huge migrant influx and transit through Montenegro towards Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia.|MDRME007
5855|The entry point is the green border near the border crossing Bozaj (along the railway and along the valley called Nikina Uvala).|MDRME007
5856|Currently, there is one main exit point in the city of Pljevlja in the northern part of the country, which borders Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (migrants cross near the border crossing at Metaljka).|MDRME007
5857|As the number of migrants in Montenegro increased, the number of asylum requests grew from 20 per month to 557 registered only in May 2018, which was the highest monthly figure in the last five years.|MDRME007
5858|The daily influx would range from 15 to 50 migrants.|MDRME007
5859|The change of the Law on asylum into Law on international and subsidiary protection brought numerous changes for the government institutions and other relevant stakeholders and partners, but more importantly also for migrants, asylum seekers and refugees with approved status in the country.|MDRME007
5860|One of the most important novelty in 2018 was the introduction of the opportunity to express intention to apply for asylum.|MDRME007
5861|By law, migrants should be able to submit their expression of intention to apply for asylum at all police facilities, but in practice it is only possible in the Detention centre.|MDRME007
5862|The document issued by the police and only available in Montenegrin language, does not state the period it is valid for, which has created a lot of problems.|MDRME007
5863|The migrants in possession of this document have 15 days to leave Montenegro or to apply for asylum.|MDRME007
5864|However, as it is not clearly stated in the document, migrants are not aware of this regulation and often stay longer in the country without filing their request for asylum, resulting in irregular status and lack of access to humanitarian assistance, including even shelter.|MDRME007
5865|Red Cross of Montenegro (RCM) teams have provided assistance to these migrants in the form of food, clothing items, first aid kits and hygiene sets.|MDRME007
5866|However, given the irregular status of many migrants, assistance provision was questionable in the eye of the authorities, but thanks to its recognized role in the society as well as to its mandate, the RCM could continue with providing assistance also to this group of migrants.|MDRME007
5867|The migrants are accommodated in three locations: the reception centre in Spuz (capacity 75 beds), an alternative accommodation in Podgorica (a rented motel, capacity 100 beds) and the detention centre in Spuz (capacity 50 beds) – used as a reception centre in case of a need.|MDRME007
5868|Given the unexpectedly high number of migrants to be supported by the different type of services of RCM in the first two months of the implementation period (up to 2,000 persons) and the newly identified target groups, the number of beneficiaries increased beyond the planned figure by the end date of the operation.|MDRME007
5869|For this reason, and to ensure continuous support to migrants, RCM requested a two-month extension of the DREF operation with an additional budget of CHF 170,940 (bringing the total budget of the operation to CHF 370,787), which served the needs of an additional 1,500 beneficiaries.|MDRME007
5870|Although the activities remained the same (distribution of food and non-food items, including first aid kits and hygiene promotion materials), the number of distributed items increased to be able to meet the needs of the newly-arrived migrants as well as those of the newly-identified target groups in the extended period.|MDRME007
5871|Furthermore, the clothing items procured and distributed in the course of the extended period were adapted to winter conditions.|MDRME007
5880|Madagascar is within the Regional Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and on January/12/2015, pressure in the zone resulted in unreasonably high amounts of rain in the city of Antananarivo.|MDRMG011
5881|The city is an area prone to flooding, with two thirds of the city classified as a flood plain, which leads to a chronic annual cycle of flooding emergencies, displacement, injury and loss of life.|MDRMG011
5882|During 2010-2013, illegal houses were constructed within the capital city without authorization in the so-called prohibited areas such as drainage canals, dykes and flood zones, where flood water and waste water are known to drain from.|MDRMG011
5883|Such factors make the flood contingency plan of Antananarivo obsolete and the authorities are yet to deal with the unauthorized housing development in the risk areas.|MDRMG011
5884|On 16 January 2015, the tropical cyclone Chezda hit Madagascar, which caused the Antananarivo pumping station (used to drain rain and waste water from the city) to break down, causing the levels of surrounding rivers to rise.|MDRMG011
5885|This led to the government issuing a red alert in the capital city.|MDRMG011
5886|The flood caused considerable damage within Madagascar’s central region (Analamanga) central, southern region (Menabe), southeast (Vatovavy Fitovinany and Atsimo Atsinanana), as well as western parts of the island.|MDRMG011
5887|As of 30 January 2015, according to preliminary assessments by the Malagasy Red Cross Society (CRM), 80,000 people had been affected, with more than 20,000 living in temporary shelters throughout the country including more than 16,000 in Antananarivo.|MDRMG011
5888|According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), 68 people were killed.|MDRMG011
5889|On 2 February 2015, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) released CHF 262,902 from the Disaster Response Emergency Fund (DREF) to support CRM to meet the immediate needs of 3,000 households (15,000 people) in the sectors of emergency shelter, non-food items (NFIs), water, sanitation and hygiene, for a period of three months.|MDRMG011
5890|As of 5 February 2015, the final official statement of the Malagasy disaster management office (Bureau National de Gestion des Risques et des Catastrophes, BNGRC) reported that 173,970 people were affected, 80 killed and 9 missing.|MDRMG011
5891|With the exception of Antananarivo, most of those who had been displaced were gradually returning to their homes by early February.|MDRMG011
5892|From 14 February 2015, rainfall increased yet again and significantly affected the regions of Alaotra Mangoro, Analamanga (including the capital, Antananarivo) and Vakinankaratra, causing landslides and 26 more people were killed.|MDRMG011
5893|After the failure of river banks to protect the Sisaony river, flooding in the greater Antananarivo worsened, and again on 27 February 2015, a red alert was declared.|MDRMG011
5894|On 9 March 2015, it was reported that 93,000 people were affected and 40,000 displaced (BNGRC).|MDRMG011
5895|In Antananarivo, 36,000 people were displaced and 1,831 houses flooded or destroyed.|MDRMG011
5896|In addition, nearly 13,100 hectares of rice fields were flooded, and many schools remained closed with others being used as temporary shelters.|MDRMG011
5897|On 6 March 2015, the Prime Minister decided to gather all of those displaced in Antananarivo in a large camp within Andohatapenaka, which was the city’s former slaughterhouse.|MDRMG011
5898|The site was originally set up to accommodate up to 24,000 displaced people.|MDRMG011
5899|The movement of people to the camp began in an ad hoc and informal manner, when neither proper infrastructure nor a registration system was in place.|MDRMG011
5900|The government of Madagascar (GoM) planned to keep this site open for three months and, in May offered the families who had nowhere to return to a resettlement program in Ankazobe, 140km north of the capital.|MDRMG011
5901|About 100 families took the offer and have since moved there.|MDRMG011
5902|On 23 March 2015, an operations update was issued extending the operation by an additional 2 months at the request of CRM with an increased DREF allocation of CHF 189,985 (totalling CHF 452,887 for the full 5 month operation) to allow for the expansion of the activities to support an additional 2,000 households (10,000 people) which were affected by the floods, and who were living in camps in the city of Antananarivo.|MDRMG011
5903|A total of 5,000 households (25,000 people) have been targeted for assistance by the CRM.|MDRMG011
5904|This DREF was replenished by the Canadian Red Cross / Government, DG ECHO, Italian Government, Korean Government and Netherlands Red Cross / Silent Emergencies Fund.|MDRMG011
5905|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID) the Medtronic and Zurich and other corporate and private donors.|MDRMG011
5906|The IFRC, on behalf of the Malagasy Red Cross Society would like to extend its thanks to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRMG011
5914|On 28 December 2014, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was hit by heavy snowfalls that resulted in snow drifts, two meters high in some places, limiting the movement of all types of vehicles on many highways and mountain corridors, and cutting the communication with a number of mountain villages.|MDRMK003
5915|Electricity lines were also cut in some of the regions, the most affected ones being Ohrid, Struga, Debar, Kichevo, Skopje, and Makedonski Brod.|MDRMK003
5916|For more than ten hours, some 150 vehicles with 500 drivers and passengers were stranded on the Skopje – Ohrid highway due to the heavy snowfall.|MDRMK003
5917|The electric power cuts lasted for a week or longer in a number of municipalities such as Ohrid, Debarca, Struga, Vevcani, Debar, Centar Zhupa, Mavrovo and Rostushalasted.|MDRMK003
5918|Although the Energy Supply Company (EVN Macedonia) immediately deployed workers to repair the seriously damaged network, the circumstances did not allow for a fast recovery of the electricity services.|MDRMK003
5919|The affected areas are situated mainly in the mountains and the access of the necessary equipment and technicians was therefore more difficult.|MDRMK003
5920|To ensure a more rapid recovery, the state also engaged the Airborne Unit of the Ministry of Interior to assist in the transport of the workers.|MDRMK003
5921|Due to the critical conditions, the Red Cross of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in cooperation with the local branches and state authorities conducted a relief operation for the most vulnerable population in those areas which are part of the System for Crisis Management.|MDRMK003
5937|In the second half of January 2015, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) was affected by heavy rainfalls and snow in the higher areas.|MDRMK004
5938|The extreme precipitation caused serious damages in the eastern part of the country, especially in the Municipality of Karbinci where the villages were immediately evacuated due to the rise of the rivers and the water level of the man-made lake in Kalimanci and Gradche.|MDRMK004
5939|With the assistance of the National Crisis Management Committee, the population was transported to the cities of Shtip and Radovish while the cattle and other farm animals were brought to the mountain pastures.|MDRMK004
5940|At the end of January further floods took place in the eastern part of the country.|MDRMK004
5941|The situation had already been critical due to the high level of water in the rivers in eastern Macedonia, and the warmer weather and rains caused an early melting of the snow which additionally worsened the situation in the affected regions.|MDRMK004
5942|The National Crisis Management Committee immediately undertook preventive measures for reducing the expected flood impact by erecting temporary dams on the most risky parts along the river beds.|MDRMK004
5943|The population from the village of Karbinci was preventively evacuated to the city of Shtip, and the population from the villages of Chesinovo and Obleshevo was brought to the city of Kochani.|MDRMK004
5944|All government institutions on national and local levels mobilized their resources.|MDRMK004
5945|During the second flooding, the consequences were much smaller due to the smaller quantity of rainfall and the preventive measures taken.|MDRMK004
5946|The floods caused significant damage to the infrastructure (local roads, bridges, wells, and water supply system) and serious consequences to the crops which is the main source of income for the farmers in the affected regions.|MDRMK004
5947|In the region of Bitola, the municipalities of Mogila and Novaci were the most affected parts.|MDRMK004
5948|The heavy rains and the high level of water from the previous months and the serious amount of debris in the riverbed of the river Crna caused serious damages to the region.|MDRMK004
5949|Although the state institutions invested significant efforts both on central and local levels in order to reduce the consequences of the flood, the water penetrated the houses of the local population.|MDRMK004
5950|In order to prevent the inundation of the village of Novaci, the authorities decided on February 4 to cut a major local road in order to prevent the flooding of the houses and the power plant REK Bitola.|MDRMK004
5951|However, the flooding damaged the water supply system, and there was also significant damage to the agricultural fields.|MDRMK004
5952|In order to restore normal life and the functioning of the power plant REK Bitola which employs most of the local population, the responsible authorities built a pedestrian bridge across the flooded area.|MDRMK004
5975|The heavy rainfall affected the western part of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in the late evening hours on 3 August 2015.|MDRMK006
5976|The heavy rain resulted in the overflow of the water from River Pena in the city of Tetovo.|MDRMK006
5977|The heavy rains were disastrous for the mountain villages of Shipkovica (2,826 residents), Dzepciste (4,051 residents), Mala Rechica (8,353 residents), Golema Rechica (1,659 residents) and Poroj (2,677 residents) and the city of Tetovo (65,000 residents).|MDRMK006
5978|The mountain villages were affected also by landslides caused by the heavy rain.|MDRMK006
5979|Based on the data obtained from the initial assessment, about 5,000 people were directly affected by the impact of the flash flood and mud slides.|MDRMK006
5980|The affected people were evacuated from the flooded villages until the houses were rehabilitated and made adequate for living.|MDRMK006
5981|Unfortunately, the heavy floods caused the death of six persons.|MDRMK006
5982|This disaster was probably the second biggest for the region after the disastrous earthquake that struck Macedonia in 1963.|MDRMK006
5983|30 persons were provided with medical care as a result of the injuries that they suffered during the storm.|MDRMK006
5984|One person was declared missing.|MDRMK006
5985|In some places, the mudflat in the affected mountain villages was up to three meters in height.|MDRMK006
5986|The Red Cross teams immediately responded and visited the affected villages and the city of Tetovo which was under water and debris.|MDRMK006
5987|The village of Shipkovica was left without electricity for several weeks and potable water for a period of one month.|MDRMK006
5988|The Red Cross immediately provided support in food and water for the affected population in Shipkovica.|MDRMK006
5989|The region was also visited by the Prime Minister of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and other state officials.|MDRMK006
5990|The personnel from the protection and Rescue Directorate worked actively to clean the affected terrain from debris and mud.|MDRMK006
5991|The initial results indicated that there was a lot of dead cattle and totally ruined fields in the villages.|MDRMK006
5992|The clearing of the villages from the debris was difficult task since these are mountainous villages where access for heavy vehicles is impossible.|MDRMK006
5993|In view of the impact of the disaster, the Government of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia declared emergency situation in the region of Tetovo and established Crisis Management HQ which met every day with the purpose of coordinating the emergency response efforts and for assessing the accomplished results.|MDRMK006
5994|The Crisis Management HQ was comprised of different state agencies and institutions (Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, Ministry of Ecology, Ministry of Health, Protection and Rescue Directorate, Centre for Crisis Management, Municipality of Tetovo and Red Cross of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.)|MDRMK006
6008|In the afternoon of 6 August 2016, torrential rains caused tremendous flash floods in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, severely affecting inhabited areas and agricultural regions in Skopje and Tetovo.|MDRMK007
6009|The rain’s volume was measured at a quantity of 97 l/m2, accompanied by strong winds of around 100 km/h.|MDRMK007
6010|The flash floods led to loss of human lives and significant material damages such as destroyed ring roads, streets, demolished vehicles and infrastructure, including water channels.|MDRMK007
6011|The most affected areas were in the northern part of Skopje, where more than 70 per cent of the houses were flooded and had the furniture, personal belongings, food stocks and accompanying infrastructure inside fully destroyed.|MDRMK007
6012|Beside Skopje, the severe flash floods also affected the area around the city of Tetovo.|MDRMK007
6013|The most affected villages and communities were: Chento, Indzikovo, Singelich, Stajkovci, Smilkovci, Creshevo, Viniche, Strachinci in the Skopje region and Shipkovica, Brodec, Veshala and Poroj in the Tetovo region.|MDRMK007
6014|In the surrounding area of Skopje, where a new ring road was being built, most of the water channels were sealed during the construction works, which caused massive water quantities to gather and form a natural dam along the road side blocks.|MDRMK007
6015|The accumulated water reached a critical level, the road collapsed and the water spilled towards the neighbouring villages flooding over 7,000 houses.|MDRMK007
6016|The floods resulted in 22 casualties and more than 60 injured people as well as large material damage.|MDRMK007
6017|In the Tetovo region, the heavy rainfall resulted in the flooding of roads between the villages Shipkovica, Brodec, Veshala and Poroj isolating these four localities.|MDRMK007
6018|Following the disaster, an initial and a second, more detailed assessment was conducted by the teams of the Red Cross of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.|MDRMK007
6019|The assessments found the following damages caused by the floods and the immediate relief needs:|MDRMK007
6029|In the afternoon of 5 January 2017, the western and northeastern parts of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia were hit by a heavy snowstorm with temperatures decreasing to as low as -25 Celsius degrees.|MDRMK008
6030|Many villages were cut off by high snowdrifts and blocked roads around Skopje, Bitola, Kriva Palanka, Debar, Makedonski Brod, Gostivar, Kumanovo, Kichevo, Struga Ohrid and Stip.|MDRMK008
6031|Motor vehicles had difficulties moving on the icy roads while the movement of heavy vehicles was banned on the mountain passes of Gostivar, Kicevo and Kriva Palanka – Kustendil.|MDRMK008
6032|Part of the settlements in Skopje (Aerodrom), Negotino and Kavadarci were left without water due to frozen or damaged pipes.|MDRMK008
6033|Three people were reported to have died in Skopje, Strumica and Pehcevo as a result of the cold and freezing temperatures.|MDRMK008
6034|Based on the needs assessment conducted by the Red Cross of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the local governments, the Crisis Management Centre and the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, 555 families were found to have been particularly affected by the extreme weather conditions.|MDRMK008
6085|In Mali, heavy rainfall led to extensive flooding from 11 to 23 July 2016.|MDRML012
6086|Regions of Gao, Mopti Ségou, and Sikasso were the worst affected by the rains and flooding.|MDRML012
6087|According to rapid assessments, some 3,098 families were affected, of which 500 were left homeless and sought refuge with neighboring families or in public buildings (schools).|MDRML012
6088|In Mopti, Ségou and Sikasso, many localities also experienced food insecurity (rated in the “Phase 2 – Orange” phase) during the “lean season”, and this was exacerbated by the flooding.|MDRML012
6089|The risk of waterborne diseases outbreak was very high given the lack of efficient waste management and rainwater draining in areas that were already prone to cholera outbreaks.|MDRML012
6090|Security in these regions remains volatile due to sporadic terrorist attacks.|MDRML012
6091|Flooding increased the vulnerability of the population.|MDRML012
6092|The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) provided technical support to Mali Red Cross (MRC) through its Sahel Country Cluster Office, in Dakar, Senegal, and Africa Regional Office, in Nairobi, Kenya.|MDRML012
6093|On 26 July 2016, an alert was issued using the IFRC Disaster Management Information System (DMIS), which indicated the intention of the MRC to request international assistance to the floods through an allocation from the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF).|MDRML012
6094|On the same day, an Operational Strategy Call was convened with representatives from the IFRC Sahel Country Cluster Office, Africa Region and Geneva and it was agreed that a DREF allocation was an appropriate modality to support the National Society response.|MDRML012
6095|Hence the releasing of CHF 203,076 from DREF to support MRC to respond to the needs of flood affected population.|MDRML012
6096|This DREF has been replenished by DG ECHO, Belgian Red Cross/Government and Netherlands Red Cross/SEF.|MDRML012
6097|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and Governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID) the Medtronic, Zurich and Coca Cola Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRML012

6120|Monsoon rains in the last week of July 2016 brought extensive flooding in several townships of Ayeyarwarddy, Bago, Magway, Mandalay, Sagaing and Yangon regions and parts of Kachin State.|MDRMM007
6121|The Relief and Resettlement Department (RRD) reported on 16 August 2016 that at least 474,560 people were displaced from their homes due to the floods.|MDRMM007
6122|State and local governments led the flood response.|MDRMM007
6123|Vulnerable areas along river banks were sandbagged and populations at risk evacuated.|MDRMM007
6124|The affected people were provided with food, water, relief items, cash and some construction materials.|MDRMM007
6125|The National Emergency Operations Centre was not activated, so the response was mostly managed at state/regional level.|MDRMM007
6126|The government coordinated with Myanmar Red Cross Society (MRCS) and civil society organizations in conducting evacuations and providing humanitarian services.|MDRMM007
6147|In the beginning of October 2016, an upsurge of violence in the northern area of Myanmar’s Rakhine State led to mass displacement amongst the local population.|MDRMM008
6148|The violence took place against a backdrop of decades of protracted tension and intercommunal violence between Rakhine and Muslim communities in Rakhine.|MDRMM008
6149|The violence was sparked by a series of coordinated attacks on 9 October on border police stations in Maungdaw and Rathedaung townships, located in the northern area of Rakhine State.|MDRMM008
6150|The attacks triggered an immediate response from security forces in Myanmar, which resulted in access to these areas being denied for humanitarian organizations and the media.|MDRMM008
6151|This however was relaxed in mid – April 2017.|MDRMM008
6152|An estimated 120,000 people from Maungdaw district affected by the communal violence fled their homes to either Bangladesh or other safer areas within northern and central areas of Rakhine state.|MDRMM008
6153|During the second quarter of 2017, the humanitarian situation related to violence in northern Rakhine remained tense especially in north and south of Maungdaw where reports of murders, killings, and kidnappings/ disappearance of targeted individuals continued.|MDRMM008
6154|Reported killings and/or arrests of community members in North and South of Rakhine were still common between Maungdaw and Buthidaung, thus posing a threat to free access and information gathering.|MDRMM008
6155|In May 2017, there were reports of bomb blasts in Buthidaung township raising fears that some people may have been attempting to make home-made bombs.|MDRMM008
6156|The authorisation to travel for INGO staff in Rakhine state gradually improved, with a caveat that international staff could only access Maungdaw township village communities when accompanied by an official from a relevant ministry.|MDRMM008
6157|However, these access constraints were later eased by the local authorities.|MDRMM008
6158|This has enabled more rapid assessments to be carried out by different humanitarian agencies in the district.|MDRMM008
6159|During the implementation of this DREF, northern part of Rakhine state, especially the townships of Maungdaw and Buthidaung, were among the coastal areas of Myanmar that was affected by Cyclone Mora between 29-30 May 2017.|MDRMM008
6160|Over 14,482 houses were partially or fully damaged in the Maungdaw and Buthidaung townships and 1,630 houses damaged in the Sittwe, Minbya and Rathedaung townships.|MDRMM008
6161|As a result, MRCS with support of IFRC, requested another DREF allocation of CHF 83,397 to support its emergency response efforts covering 1,000 households (5,000 people) in most affected townships of Maungdaw (500 households), Minbya (300 households) and Buthidaung (200 households) located in both the northern and central areas of Rakhine state.|MDRMM008
6162|The operation1 which provided relief items; family kits, hygiene parcels, dignity kits and unconditional cash specifically for Minbya township ended on 30 September 2017.|MDRMM008
6163|MRCS response to Cyclone Mora had an impact on this operation and led to a shift in priority amid growing operational challenges.|MDRMM008
6184|Tropical cyclone Mora made landfall on the coast of Bangladesh between Cox's Bazaar and the city of Chittagong on 30 May 2017.|MDRMM009
6185|Myanmar’s Rakhine state was severely hit, particularly in the northern areas of the state, and the states/regions of Chin, Ayeyarwady, Magway and Sagaing.|MDRMM009
6186|MRCS conducted a rapid assessment in the affected townships to assess the needs of the affected population.|MDRMM009
6187|According to government figures, 67 school buildings were completely destroyed, 297 houses partially damage, 4 health facilities destroyed while 45 public facilities were damaged in Maungdaw and Buthidaung townships.|MDRMM009
6188|In central Rakhine, 86 educational facilities were damaged (11 educational facilities collapsed, 33 severely damaged and 42 had minor damages).|MDRMM009
6189|Affected population whose shelters were destroyed by the tropical winds had increased risks to ailments as they were exposed to the elements.|MDRMM009
6190|Schools which was reopened on 1 June required materials for repairs as well as furniture.|MDRMM009
6191|The respective township education officers worked together with humanitarian partners in identifying the schools that needed repairs and rehabilitation.|MDRMM009
6192|Damages caused by TC Mora compounded the already difficult humanitarian situation in Rakhine state.|MDRMM009
6193|The context was characterized by protracted tension and communal violence, with displacement of 145,000 people in 2012.|MDRMM009
6194|Violence flared up again in October 2016 in Maungdaw and Rathedaung townships, causing up to 94,000 people to flee their homes to other parts of northern Rakhine or across the border into Bangladesh.|MDRMM009
6195|The situation prompted MRCS with the support of IFRC to request for a DREF for complex emergencies worth CHF 69,653.|MDRMM009
6196|The operation aims to provide assistance to 1,000 households in northern areas of Rakhine state between February – July 2017 by supporting MRCS emergency response readiness and conducting needs assessments.|MDRMM009
6197|The TC Mora operation therefore occurred in the middle of ongoing complex emergency operation which have affected the capacity of the response as the capacity of MRCS was further stretched.|MDRMM009
6198|Implementation of the cyclone mora operation (June – September 2017) coincided with two emergency operations in Rakhine state.|MDRMM009
6199|In the beginning, the operation coincided with the complex emergency operation which ended on 19 July 2017.|MDRMM009
6200|A joint Movement response for population movement started on August 2017 which coincided with this operation at the end of its implementation period.|MDRMM009
6201|Security situation remained tense during the implementation period, with reports pointing to armed clashes with unknown armed groups, the discovery of weapons and other military equipment, and deaths of civilians.|MDRMM009
6202|In July 2017 reports suggested that areas of Maungdaw and Buthidaung townships remained under active military activity with additional reports of civilian deaths, including a local INGO aid worker in Maungdaw township.|MDRMM009
6203|It remained difficult to verify the security incidents reports coming in, which further escalated uncertainty in what already was an unstable humanitarian situation and security environment.|MDRMM009
6204|With an increased security risk and the enforcement of a curfew (9PM – 5AM), the above situation placed severe operational constraints on the implementation of this DREF.|MDRMM009
6214|Heavy seasonal monsoon brought strong winds and heavy rains across Myanmar since the beginning of July 2018, causing increased water levels in major rivers and floods in many regions and states.|MDRMM011
6215|The regions of Nay Pyi Taw, Bago, Tanintharyi, Magway, Sagaing and Ayeyarwady as well as Mon and Kayin states were reported to have been affected.|MDRMM011
6216|Due to heavy rainfall, the Department of Meteorology and Hydrology (DMH) noted several rivers which either exceeded or was close to danger levels.|MDRMM011
6217|The DMH issued flood warnings for several rivers including Chindwin, Ngawun, Sittoung, Bago where water levels approached or exceeded the danger levels.|MDRMM011
6218|It was reported that water had reached as high as eight (8) feet in some affected areas.|MDRMM011
6219|Based on information from the Government’s Department for Disaster Management (DDM), a total of 147,613 people from 21,930 households were temporarily displaced and 16 people lost their lives due to the floods.|MDRMM011
6220|The most-affected areas with reported displacements were Bago region (11,974 households), Mon (5,727 households) and Kayin states (4,229 households).|MDRMM011
6221|The displaced people had taken shelter in evacuation sites or stayed with relatives and host families.|MDRMM011
6222|With flood waters receding as the monsoon culminated in mid-September, most of the people in evacuation sites or those living with host families and relatives, returned to their places of origin.|MDRMM011
6272|Dzud (or ‘zud’ ???) is a condition created by threat multipliers and inter-linked factors that exacerbates already fragile situations of livestock herders in Mongolia.|MDRMN007
6273|This term is unique to pastoral communities in Central Asia, and can be caused by a combination of summer drought, heavy snowfall, and high winds in concurrence with extremely low winter temperatures which combine to cause unsustainable conditions for animal survival.|MDRMN007
6274|In this condition, mortality of the livestock is caused by a combination of starvation because of being unable to graze and access fodder due to heavy snow, ice or drought, freezing due to extreme cold temperature, exposure to storms and wind, and a weakened immune system response due to the exposure.|MDRMN007
6275|Mongolia has suffered from severe winter conditions known as Dzud for three consecutive years.|MDRMN007
6276|The extremely harsh winter that continued after the drought in summer 2017 has depleted the herders’ reserves of hay and fodder.|MDRMN007
6277|Continuous harsh conditions have put at risk millions of livestock, which are the only source of food, transport and income for almost half of the Mongolian population.|MDRMN007
6278|As herders experienced two consecutive droughts throughout the country followed by severe winters, it did not allow herders enough recovery time to be prepared for the winter of 2017-2018.|MDRMN007
6279|According to an official statement of NEMA issued on 31 January 2018, about 70 per cent of the country was covered in 10-45 cm deep snow with density from 0.12-0.36 gr/cm3.|MDRMN007
6280|Out of 330 soums in 21 provinces, 141 soums in 20 provinces and one city experienced extreme winter situation.|MDRMN007
6281|The temperatures dropped to -30 to -46.5 degrees Celsius below freezing point during the nights.|MDRMN007
6282|This condition persisted for the whole month of February 2018.|MDRMN007
6283|Therefore, NEMA issued warning messages on possible extreme winter to herders and mobilized local resources such as hay and fodder to provinces that maybe badly affected and are at high risk.|MDRMN007
6284|The livestock death toll reached 1,116,880 by March 2018.|MDRMN007
6285|The outbreak of livestock infectious disease in 13 out of 21 provinces of Mongolia was one of the multiplying factors that resulted in deaths of livestock aside from the harsh winter conditions.|MDRMN007
6303|Between July 10 to July 15, heavy rainfall caused flash flooding that swept across various parts of the country including 12 provinces (Bayan-Ulgii, Selenge, Tuv, Khovd, Uvurkhangai, Arkhangai, Bulgan, Dornod, Khuvsgul, Sukhbaatar, Zavkhan, Dornogovi).|MDRMN008
6304|Roughly, 2,264 households had been affected in total and out of the affected areas, Bayan-Ulgii province had been the most severely affected that 929 households (approximately 3,500 people) had been directly affected by the flooding which caused severe damage to vital Infrastructure, property, livestock and crops.|MDRMN008
6305|In BayanUlgii province, out of 530 households who had been severely affected by the flooding, 185 households (668 people) were evacuated into 8 temporary shelters, 345 households (1844 people) were evacuated to safe areas.|MDRMN008
6306|Pit toilets are most commonly used in the flooded areas and most of the toilets had been overflown by the flood water contaminating the area and drinking water sources.|MDRMN008
6307|The LEMA had mobilized over 600 people and 100 units of technical equipment to the affected area to drain the flood water, restore flood-gates, dams and remove the concrete debris left by mudflow and flood sanitation infrastructure.|MDRMN008
6308|In Bayan-Ulgii, 260 hectares of thick contaminated mud and debris had covered the flooded area and the affected population had been provided with safe drinking water by water trucks.|MDRMN008
6309|A needs assessment and registration of the beneficiaries had been conducted by the multi-agency team including MRCS and other NGOs, governmental units in the area in Bayan-Ulgii.|MDRMN008
6310|NDRT and BDRT members were deployed to other provinces to assess the situation.|MDRMN008
6311|The affected people were in urgent need for shelter, food, non-food items (NFIs), water, sanitation, hygiene (WASH), and health assistance.|MDRMN008
6312|The initial operational plan was to assist 475 households in the affected areas, but MRCS had been requested by the State Emergency Commission officially on 19 July 2018, to scale up relief assistance to the flood affected provinces.|MDRMN008
6313|A detailed assessment was conducted subsequently by MRCS, confirming that there are needs in other locations which were not covered under initial DREF operation.|MDRMN008
6314|Thus, in addition to the initial DREF operation, which covers Uvurkhangai, Khovd provinces, the MRCS requested for a second DREF allocation to support sustainable interventions to assist 430 households in 10 more provinces (Arkhangai, Bulgan, Dornod, Khuvsgul, Sukhbaatar, Umnugovi, Zavkhan, Dornogovi, Selenge, Tuv) extending the operation timeframe to four months.|MDRMN008
6315|As the plan of action is updated, number of people to be assisted increased from 2,220 to 4,098 people.|MDRMN008
6365|The 2016-2017 rainy season in Mauritania was characterized by a fifty-eight percent decrease compared to the previous year.|MDRMR008
6366|Indeed, rainfall deficits exceeding 100 mm were recorded in several Wilayas in the south of the country, notably at the level of the two Hodhs (administrative regions), in Assaba, Brakna, Gorgol, Trarza and in Guidimagha.|MDRMR008
6367|The situation greatly affected crop production, particularly rain-fed crops, which in most areas produced low or even nonexistent output levels.|MDRMR008
6368|This drop in agricultural production impacted on rural populations, particularly in rain-fed areas (along the border strip) and in the traditional areas of Aftout, where the highest rates of food insecurity were recorded during that period.|MDRMR008
6369|The vulnerable households experienced a decline in their income from agricultural activities, either in terms of selfconsumption (cereals) or in terms of income from sales or rural work.|MDRMR008
6370|In urban areas, the food situation remained stable in general, with a food insecurity rate of less than 20 percent.|MDRMR008
6371|However, the peripheral areas of Nouakchott, due to the high density of the population, remained in terms of numbers, the main concentration zone of food-insecure populations.|MDRMR008
6372|It is worth mentioning that in Mauritania, the prevalence of acute overall malnutrition (MAG) is 9.5 percent.|MDRMR008
6373|This rate also confirmed the trends observed in the different nutritional surveys carried out in the post-harvest period.|MDRMR008
6374|Besides, population movements and insecurity aggravated the severity of food insecurity, increasing of the number of persons in crisis or in emergency status on the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) scale.|MDRMR008
6375|As such, a CHF 206,067 support was requested from the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to assist the populations of Brakna and Gorgol who had high percentages of malnutrition cases.|MDRMR008
6376|The target number of persons to receive assistance for the two regions was set to 9,750 or 1,625 households2.|MDRMR008
6377|The DREF operation was geared towards addressing the needs of vulnerable pockets of populations identified in Brakna and Gorgol communes.|MDRMR008
6378|This helped the Mauritanian Red Crescent (MRC) to take part in the coordination efforts towards supporting communities suffering from food insecurity together with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) as well as other partners of the food security cluster.|MDRMR008
6379|While responding to the crisis, the MRC also thought of strengthening the resilience of vulnerable households and improve the capacity of national actors to cope with future shocks.|MDRMR008
6380|Indeed, these objectives aimed at addressing an integrated response including immediate food assistance during the lean season as well as, strengthening or restoring livelihoods (depending on favourable conditions).|MDRMR008
6381|In addition, this DREF operation equally aimed at conducting an indepth needs assessment to allow NS develop a long-term plan to address issues pertaining to the food crisis in Sahel region.|MDRMR008
6382|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), AECID, the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRMR008
6383|The IFRC, on behalf of the Mauritanian Red Crescent, would like to extend many thanks to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRMR008
6394|In October 2017, a plague outbreak in Madagascar raised concern in neighbouring countries.|MDRMU001
6395|By 12 October 2017 a total 684 cases (suspected, probable and confirmed) including 57 deaths (CFR 8.3%) had been reported from 35 out of 114 districts.|MDRMU001
6396|Of these 684 cases, 474 were clinically classified as pneumonic plague.|MDRMU001
6397|The Ministry of Health in Madagascar reported on 16 October that caseload was 805 (confirmed and suspected) with 74 deaths.|MDRMU001
6398|While Madagascar is accustomed to seasonal bubonic plague outbreaks, the 2017 outbreak was characterised by a combination of pneumonic and bubonic plague.|MDRMU001
6399|Pneumonic plague which accounted for 65% of the caseload, is transmitted from person to person and the fact that most of the cases occurred in urban areas, made this outbreak a serious concern not only for Madagascar but for the entire region.|MDRMU001
6400|Consequently, WHO classified the outbreak in Madagascar as a grade 2 emergency and the WHO liaison officer expressed concern of the outbreak and considered Mauritius as a priority country.|MDRMU001
6401|He equally emphasized that preparedness was essential and stated that support could be provided.|MDRMU001
6402|Plague can be a very severe disease in people, particularly in its septicemic and pneumonic forms, with a case-fatality ratio of 30%-100% if left untreated.|MDRMU001
6403|The pneumonic form is invariably fatal unless treated early, is especially contagious and can trigger severe epidemics through person-to-person contact via droplets in the air1.|MDRMU001
6404|Through this DREF operation, Mauritius RC was granted CHF 39,650 for plague preparedness for 315,750 people (25% of the caseload) at risk for 03 months through provision of training for volunteers on the plague, prepositioning of PPE and IEC materials to be used in time of need.|MDRMU001
6405|Following the launch of the DREF operation and release of the funds, WHO revised the risk of the plague outbreak spreading beyond the borders of Madagascar.|MDRMU001
6406|This resulted in a change in strategy especially, affecting the activities that could be implemented in Mauritius.|MDRMU001
6407|Indeed, recommendations were made to stop implementation of community-based activities on the plague.|MDRMU001
6408|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), AECID, the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRMU001
6409|On behalf of the Mauritius Red Cross Society (MRCS), the IFRC would like to extend its gratitude to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRMU001
6515|Malawi experienced normal to above normal rainfall within most of its regions.|MDRMW013
6516|Karonga district, which is located in the Northern Part of the country, received above normal rainfall mid-March which resulted in extensive flooding in most of the district.|MDRMW013
6517|The flooding resulted in infrastructural damage as well as displacement of families in the affected communities.|MDRMW013
6518|The displaced families were evacuated to nearby schools where camps were set up for them to stay until the water subsided.|MDRMW013
6519|A total number of 8,286 households (55,921 people) were affected by the flooding.|MDRMW013
6520|About 665 houses collapsed whilst others were partly damaged.|MDRMW013
6521|Most of the collapsed houses were semi-permanent structures.|MDRMW013
6522|The affected households comprised of 4,759 farming families (2,974 male-headed households and 1,785 female-headed households).|MDRMW013
6523|The remaining 3,527 households included those whose houses had been damaged partially.|MDRMW013
6524|Of the affected population, 4,467 were children under-five years, 385 elderly people, 261 orphans and 15 people living with disabilities.|MDRMW013
6525|Sequel to this impact, the MRCS with support from the IFRC launched a DREF for CHF 223,930 on 9 May 2017 to support the NS to conduct an initial rapid needs assessment, while support mainly focused on ensuring that the vulnerable communities have increased access to appropriate and sustainable water, sanitation and hygiene.|MDRMW013
6526|It was also aimed at ensuring that communities in disaster and crisis affected areas restore and strengthen their safety, wellbeing and longer-term recovery through shelter and settlement solutions.|MDRMW013
6527|During the course of this operation, the NS issued one operational update which extended the timeframe by three months, changing the operational end date from July 2017 to October 2017.|MDRMW013
6528|The revision followed a Needs Assessment which was conducted by the MRCS and other stakeholders to ascertain the needs of the affected communities.|MDRMW013
6529|This was on the basis that by the time the NS received funds, the people had already started going back to their homes from the camps.|MDRMW013
6530|As such, some of the activities that were meant for a camp set up could no longer be implemented.|MDRMW013
6531|Since the situation on the ground had evolved, some activities budgeted for under the wash component like the procurement of handwashing buckets could no longer be implemented hence the resources under this activity in the budget were to be reallocated for decommissioning of the latrines and training of volunteers in hygiene promotion.|MDRMW013
6532|The extension also allowed for the finalization of international procurements.|MDRMW013
6533|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), AECID, the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRMW013
6534|The IFRC, on behalf of Malawi Red Cross Society, would like to extend many thanks to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRMW013
6566|Heavy seasonal rain and strong winds affected most parts of Malaysia starting in midDecember 2014 and continued into the first weeks of January 2015.|MDRMY002
6567|The rain caused severe flooding in the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia – the states of Terengganu, Pahang, and Kelantan.|MDRMY002
6568|The heavy and prolonged rain also coincided with higher than normal tides, which effectively inhibited flood waters from draining to the sea.|MDRMY002
6569|At the peak of the flooding, more than 230,000 people were evacuated and at least 17 people were confirmed dead.|MDRMY002
6570|There are no official figures of the total number of people affected, but based on the number of displaced, it can be estimated that between 500,000 to 1 million people were affected, directly or indirectly.|MDRMY002
6571|Communities affected by the floods left evacuation centres in January 2015, and schools have reopened.|MDRMY002
6572|Families whose homes were partially or completely destroyed are either living in tents, temporary shelters or with host families.|MDRMY002
6573|Communities and local government representatives indicate that they have received sufficient food items and remaining needs are for water, sanitation and shelter.|MDRMY002
6574|As of 1st June 2015, MRCS continues to operate in the affected areas, providing relief support to affected communities.|MDRMY002
6575|While the government has announced that the situation is now in a ‘recovery phase’, some immediate needs still remains especially in critically hit areas such as Kuala Krai.|MDRMY002
6576|Almost all of the affected communities have moved back to their kampongs with less than 4 households are still living which is mostly in Kampung Aur Duri.|MDRMY002
6577|MRCS/IFRC is scaling up the shelter projects with 16 Temporary Shelters completed in Kampung Aur Duri, Dusun Nyior and Kampung Keluat.|MDRMY002
6578|Furthermore MRCS/IFRC have conducted assessment in other villages in Kuala Krai namely Kampung Pahi and Kampung Bahagia were there will be interventions in Shelter, Watsan and Health sectors.|MDRMY002
6579|As in 15th June 2015, MRCS have started to build 23 shelters in Kampung Bahagia.|MDRMY002
6580|Longer-term, MRCS plans to do community-based integrated rehabilitation and risk reduction programming in the same communities, including small-scale mitigation, community preparedness, monitoring and early warning, shelter, water and sanitation, health and livelihoods.|MDRMY002
6581|Existing IFRC approaches such as community based DRR (CBDRR) and community based health and first aid (CBHFA) will be used.|MDRMY002
6582|For more details, see the Plan of Action.|MDRMY002
6594|Heavy rains that started in December 2016 continued until late January 2017 in parts of Malaysia, causing flooding in seven states of Peninsular Malaysia – Johor, Kelantan, Pahang, Perak, Terengganu, Malacca and Selangor – and Sabah in East Malaysia.|MDRMY003
6595|More than 23,000 people, mainly from smaller towns and villages in rural areas, had to leave their homes to established relief centres.|MDRMY003
6596|The situation improved significantly after the weekend of Lunar New Year (28-29 January), with floodwater receding in several affected districts, allowing families that were in relief centres to return home.|MDRMY003
6597|National Agency for Disaster Administration (NADMA) reported that the state of Johor suffered the brunt of rising waters, with more than 8,000 evacuees and a fatality.|MDRMY003
6598|More information on the floods can be obtained from Information Bulletin n°1 (issued on 5 January), Information Bulletin n°2 (issued on 27 January) and Information Bulletin n°3 (issued on 2 February).|MDRMY003
6612|On 15 February 2017, a strong cyclone moving from the Indian Ocean landed and hit the Southern coastal part of Mozambique bringing with it strong winds exceeding 100km/hr., rough sea and torrential rains.|MDRMZ013
6613|According to MTOTEC (satellite imagery, surface analysis, and storm system information for the South West Indian Ocean cyclone basin), the storm evolved from severe tropical storm to Category III Tropical Cyclone and reclassified as Ex-Dineo, affecting Inhambane province.|MDRMZ013
6614|A total number of 11 districts of Inhambane province were affected by the cyclone, namely, Inhambane City, Funhalouro, Homoine, Jangamo, Inharrime, Massinga, Maxixe, Morrumbene, Vilanculos, Panda, and Zavala.|MDRMZ013
6615|Projection figures provided by National Institute of Disaster Management (INGC), declared approximately 750,000 people affected.|MDRMZ013
6616|The affected population moved to safer areas as their houses were flooded.|MDRMZ013
6617|From 19 February, 04 accommodation centers were established in Maxixe and Inhambane City Districts.|MDRMZ013
6618|Between 19 and 20 February, Mozambique Red Cross Society staff and volunteers joined the National Committee for disaster management for a joint assessment of the affected areas.|MDRMZ013
6619|The CVM conducted assessment in Inhambane City, Jangamo and Vilanculos, as part of Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) response strategy.|MDRMZ013
6620|On 24 February, the Government officially published the estimated figures of the impact of the cyclone, indicating that 550,000 people were affected.|MDRMZ013
6621|Of those affected, 6,506 households were rated as the most vulnerable.|MDRMZ013
6622|A total number of 33,014 houses were totally destroyed, whilst 62 houses were partially destroyed.|MDRMZ013
6623|Seven deaths were recorded, whilst 15 people severely injured and 85 people had minor injuries.|MDRMZ013
6624|Some 13,477 hectares of crops had been inundated.|MDRMZ013
6625|A DREF allocation of CHF 113, 532 was approved on 18 February by the IFRC to support the CVM to conduct assessments and monitoring in the affected areas and assist 1,000 households with emergency shelter.|MDRMZ013
6626|The DREF was revised after a needs’ assessment to a total of CHF 241,938 to meet the needs of 500 more beneficiaries in Gaza province.|MDRMZ013
6638|Heavy rains during the period of January-March 2017 within the Cuvelai River Basin in Angola and localized rainfalls in Oshana, Oshikoto, Ohangwena, Omusati resulted in localized flooding in Lishana (shallow flood plains).|MDRNA010
6639|On 09 March 2017, the Hydrological Services Namibia (HSN) in the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry (MAWF) in collaboration with the Directorate of Disaster Risk Management in the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM), and Meteorological Services issued a joint statement on the looming floods.|MDRNA010
6640|HSN further warned that the flooding situation in the Cuvelai was comparable to that of 2011, which caused major damages in houses and infrastructure and requested for contingency preparedness and activation.|MDRNA010
6641|The Hydrological Department in Ondjiva in Angola informed HSN that flood water had reached and flooded Ondjiva, which was likely to increase water levels in Namibian Cuvelai Lishana because of heavy rainfall in the catchment area.|MDRNA010
6642|HSN hydrological gauging stations recorded highest water levels as compared to the floods that hit the same areas in 2008, 2009 and 2011 due to heaving rains in Namibia and in the bordering areas.|MDRNA010
6643|Through the Regional Disaster Risk Management Committees of Oshana and Omusati regions, Namibia Red Cross Society Regional staff conducted field visits to relocation camps in both regions to investigate the extent and impact of the floods.|MDRNA010
6644|A total number of 182 Households (1,092 people) were displaced and in need of emergency assistance.|MDRNA010
6645|Although response mainly targeted households those who relocated away from home, provision was made to extreme cases presented to the Regional Disaster Management Committees where the NRCS is a member and upon verification assistance was rendered to all affected 417 households.|MDRNA010
6646|The table below highlights the total number of the affected people:|MDRNA010
6647|In Zambezi region, the Zambezi River was flowing at 6.44m compared to 5.6m the same time last year.|MDRNA010
6648|The Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry the 12th April 2017 confirmed that a flood wave was developing in upstream Zambia at Lukulu, and it was expected that water levels in Zambezi region would rise again.|MDRNA010
6649|So far, the floods in Zambezi region have displaced 1410 people and this number was at risk of rising to 2,000 people as more flood waves hit Namibia from Zambia.|MDRNA010
6650|The floods limited the access of some communities to basic services such as health and education.|MDRNA010
6651|Most of the schools remained inaccessible, resulting in school children and teachers having to walk through water channels to access education and health facilities in other areas.|MDRNA010
6652|Displaced communities in relocation camps had limited access to proper accommodation, sanitation facilities, access to safe clean water, and lack of preventative items such as mosquito nets.|MDRNA010
6653|This increased the likelihood of outbreak of diseases such as Malaria and Diarrhoea.|MDRNA010
6654|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), AECID, the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRNA010
6655|On behalf of the Namibia Red Cross Society (NRCS), the IFRC would like to extend its gratitude to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRNA010
6710|On 30th August 2016, Tahoua region alerted the National level of cases of fever with jaundice and bleeding complications in humans, leading to death in most affected cases at community level.|MDRNE016
6711|Most cases were reported/recorded in the Health District of Tchintabaraden.|MDRNE016
6712|On the side of livestock, it was found during the same period of abortions in small ruminants and mortality in young calves.|MDRNE016
6713|Tahoua region is located in the Southwest part of Niger and covers an area of 113,371 km² with an estimated population of 2,741,922 people.|MDRNE016
6714|The Health District Tchintabaraden is one of eight districts of the Tahoua region, which covers an area of about 54,000 km² with an estimated population of 250,726 people.|MDRNE016
6715|The main livelihood activity of the communities in the affected area is agriculture and animal breeding.|MDRNE016
6716|The results of the Laboratory test provided by the “Institut Pasteur de Dakar” on 16th September 2016 confirmed the Rift Valley Fever (RVF) in Tchintabaraden zone.|MDRNE016
6717|From week 31 (August 02) to week 37 (September 18), a total of 52 affected cases including 21 deaths (case fatality rate 40.3%) were reported in the Tchintabaraden district.|MDRNE016
6718|The outbreak has spread to 2 other districts (Tassara and Abalak) as of 21 September 2016, the total number of affected cases recorded were 60 with 23 deaths.|MDRNE016
6719|The statistics mention that 87% of the affected population were above the age of 15 years with 63% of them being males while 95% are pastoralists.|MDRNE016
6720|As of 28 September, 78 cases were recorded with 26 deaths.|MDRNE016
6721|In terms of livestock, animals with hyperthermia, breathing difficulties, hyper salivation (animal drooling), bleeding in the various parts, abortions in small ruminants, mortalities among young calves were found.|MDRNE016
6722|The milk of some animals aborted was streaked with blood.|MDRNE016
6723|Interviews with the community has identified 363 cases of animal abortions and 370 deaths of young animals (Source: Ministry of Public Health, WHO).|MDRNE016
6724|Following this confirmation, the Government declared Rift Valley Fever outbreak on 20 September 2016, appealing for international support.|MDRNE016
6725|The Government also took preventive and curative measures such as providing treatment to the affected people, reinforcing the social mobilization (information and communication in the communities and via media), and increasing epidemic surveillance.|MDRNE016
6726|The Ministry of Livestock was in charge of caring on animals and properly burying the corpse of dead animal.|MDRNE016
6727|After the official declaration of the epidemic, the Ministry of Health (MoH) requested all its partners in the country to mobilize efforts in order stop the spread of the epidemic through awareness campaign and community-based epidemiological surveillance.|MDRNE016
6728|The Niger Red Cross (NRCs) society was specifically called upon to support the Government with community based activities.|MDRNE016
6729|Based on this request, the NRCs solicited the support of its Movement partners and specifically the IFRC through a DREF worth CHF 99, 514.|MDRNE016
6730|The DREF activities were mainly implemented in the Tahoua region of the country.|MDRNE016
6757|Niger is a country in its large part located in the African meningitis belt (the Lapeyssonnie belt).|MDRNE017
6758|The country is recurrently facing meningitis epidemic outbreaks that vary in magnitude from one year to another.|MDRNE017
6759|Climate change and demographic factors affecting the world today have increased the frequency of meningitis outbreak, from 8 to 10 years in the past to 2 to 3 years in recent years.|MDRNE017
6760|Since the beginning of 2017, the meningitis epidemic situation in Niger has continued getting worse.|MDRNE017
6761|As a result, the number of affected cases is exponentially increasing.|MDRNE017
6762|According to the MoH, from 1 January to 31 May 2017, at least 3,199 cases of Meningitis have been reported including 196 deaths (lethality rate of 6%).|MDRNE017
6763|By 8 June 2017, there had been a total of 3,303 suspected and confirmed cases, with 197 deaths.|MDRNE017
6764|However, surveillance is continuing.|MDRNE017
6765|The report also indicated that the number of cases has fallen gradually and by 20 June 2017, there were only 04 suspected cases and no districts in epidemic or alert status.|MDRNE017
6766|The type of meningitis that affected Niger is Meningococcal C and children aged 5 –14 years are by far the most affected group.|MDRNE017
6767|This epidemic outbreak was officially declared by the MoH through a press conference held on 29 March 2017.|MDRNE017
6768|The MoH has declared the meningitis epidemic outbreak in three health centres in the district of the second neighbourhood of Niamey, including the districts of Foulankoira health Centre, Lazaret and Boukoki.|MDRNE017
6769|Further, the Minister indicated that these three health centres of the affected areas reported a total of 90 cases of Meningitis including 4 deaths, from January 1 to March 28.|MDRNE017
6770|According to the MoH, six other health districts in the country were on alert, namely Niamey III and IV, Kollo, Tillabery region, Koni (Tahoua region), Djoundjou (Dosso region), and Tchibiri in the Maradi region.|MDRNE017
6771|Other areas continue to record sporadic cases but have not reached the epidemic threshold.|MDRNE017
6772|With regard to the above, the MoH launched a vaccination campaign on 06 April 2017, exclusively in the three affected districts of Niamey because there were only 133,000 doses of vaccines available in the country.|MDRNE017
6773|The vaccination programme targeted people aged 2 20 years; with some 10,200 people for the first phase.|MDRNE017
6774|This limited supply prompted MoH to start vaccination in Niamey.|MDRNE017
6775|An additional supply arrived from Copenhagen two weeks after the vaccination campaign had started.|MDRNE017
6776|Further, the Minister of Health announced that the vaccination campaign will target districts of high-population density and at-risk, but outside of Niamey.|MDRNE017
6777|On this occasion, the Minister of Health has called upon all its technical and financial partners, national and international NGOs, civil society organizations, public and private sectors and all the goodwill to accompany the MoH in response to this epidemic.|MDRNE017
6778|In response, the RCSN organized an emergency training for 10 volunteers who started awareness session on Meningitis control and prevention in the communities in and around Niamey.|MDRNE017
6801|Hepatitis E virus is probably the leading cause of viral hepatitis in the world.|MDRNE018
6802|The global burden of Morbidity Study (WHO, 2010) estimated that at least 20.1 million people are infected globally by the virus genotypes 1 and 2 every year, out of which only 3.4 million people reported the disease, resulting in 70,000 deaths and 3,000 new-borns baby deaths.|MDRNE018
6803|All hepatitis E viruses that can cause disease to human being belong to a single serotype.|MDRNE018
6804|Nevertheless, there are four different genotypes; genotypes 1 and 2 are predominantly faecal-oral as the virus is transmitted by water and / or person to person in the context of low drinking water quality and where the risk of faecal pollution is naturally high or aggravated by seasonal flooding.|MDRNE018
6805|The most common clinical presentation starts with a prodromal phase of 1 to 10 days with non-specific flulike symptoms such as fatigue, discomfort, anorexia, nausea and vomiting.|MDRNE018
6806|A fever limited between (38-39°C) is common.|MDRNE018
6807|The first distinctive signs of Hepatitis are often dark urine, pale clay coloured stools, followed by the appearance of a jaundice.|MDRNE018
6808|As a result of the appearance of jaundice, prodromal symptoms generally disappear.|MDRNE018
6809|More often, the infection heals spontaneously after approximately 2 weeks, however in some cases, a fulminant form of Hepatitis develops.|MDRNE018
6810|During pregnancy, hepatitis E is the main cause of miscarriages, new-born baby deaths, preterm delivery, increased risk of neonatal complications such as hypoglycaemia and transmission of the Hepatitis virus E from mother to child.|MDRNE018
6811|In addition to sporadic transmission, genotypes 1 and 2 can cause large-scale epidemics outbreak that can last several months or even years.|MDRNE018
6812|Located in the Sahara area, Niger has experienced recurrent and persistent epidemic outbreaks in recent years due to certain diseases, particularly meningitis, measles and recently Rift Valley fever.|MDRNE018
6813|In 2017, the country experienced its first hepatitis E epidemic virus (HEV) outbreak recorded in the region of Diffa.|MDRNE018
6814|As of 29 June 2017, the total number of suspected cumulative cases of hepatitis E was 1,096 of which 34 deaths.|MDRNE018
6815|The trend analysis showed a gradual increase in cases.|MDRNE018
6816|According to medical doctors, when the rainy season starts, meningitis slows down while Hepatitis E increases.|MDRNE018
6817|As per UNOCHA snapshots from 24 October 2017, at least 2,035 suspected or confirmed cases were reported as of 24 October with at least 38 deaths.|MDRNE018
6818|The lethality rate moved from 29% on 25 April to 1.86% by 24 October 2017.|MDRNE018
6819|There was also a decrease in the number of cases from 10 July 2017.|MDRNE018
6820|The report also indicated that the women and people aged 15 and above were the most affected with the highest number of cases reported in Diffa.|MDRNE018
6821|To address this situation, the Government through the Ministry of Public Health in collaboration with its Technical and Financial Partners are implementing activities to eradicate this epidemic.|MDRNE018
6822|It is within this framework that Niger’s Ministry of Public Health called upon the humanitarian organizations who are active in the field of health including Niger Red Cross Society, to contribute in the response to this epidemic outbreak.|MDRNE018
6823|Further, the Minister of Health purposely called upon the National Society’s President to involve volunteers through community-based awareness sessions and WASH activities.|MDRNE018
6824|Based on the MoH’s solicitation, the President, during the Movement coordination meeting held on 28 May 2017, invited all Movement partners to support the NS to respond to the Government request.|MDRNE018
6825|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), AECID, the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRNE018
6826|On behalf of Niger Red Cross Society (NRCS), the IFRC would like to extend its gratitude to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRNE018
6894|In March 2017, the Cadre Harmonisé (CH) on food security situation reported that the Sahel region was facing another food insecurity crisis with a scale considered to be the fifth largest food insecurity crisis since the year 2005.|MDRNE019
6895|Within the last 15 years, the food crisis cycle has occurred in the years 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2017.|MDRNE019
6896|These consecutive crisis, mainly caused by drought and lack of rainfall, have left local populations each time in a deeper state of vulnerability to food insecurity issues.|MDRNE019
6897|In addition to this, civil insecurity, banditry and inter-communal conflicts, coupled with the disruption of livelihoods and the depletion of food stocks during the lean season, were among the factors that drastically limited the availability and access to food in the most affected areas.|MDRNE019
6898|This situation was exacerbated by alarming displacement of people, involving nearly 4.9 million internally displaced people and refugees; an increase in food prices by 10 percent compared to the average and a drastic drop in the prices of the animals.|MDRNE019
6899|Coastal countries and Nigeria have experienced high food price increase which, coupled with local currency depreciation, have reduced the purchasing power of households.|MDRNE019
6900|These compounding factors have minimized the capacity of local populations to adapt to reinforce their coping mechanism and become resilient.|MDRNE019
6901|In Niger, the Food security situation continued to be alarming.|MDRNE019
6902|According to the FEWSNET report on Food security situation in Niger published in February 2018, the reportedly Stressed (IPC Phase 2) food security outcomes for poor households in pastoral areas in February 2018 could extend to the month of September 2018 with the premature deterioration of pastoral conditions as a result of the pasture deficit.|MDRNE019
6903|Certain poor households in agricultural and agropastoral areas will be facing these same conditions through September 2018 due to the premature depletion of their food stocks and their weak purchasing power.|MDRNE019
6904|Armed attacks continue to disrupt local livelihoods and markets in the Diffa region, hindering trading opportunities with Nigeria and Libya.|MDRNE019
6905|The persistent Crisis (IPC Phase 3) levels of acute food insecurity in this region will extend through at least September 2018.|MDRNE019
6906|Without assistance, certain poor pastoral households could be facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) conditions in June-July 2018.|MDRNE019
6907|Malnutrition is also a major public health problem and a challenge for development in Niger.|MDRNE019
6908|Since the 2005 emergency, the prevalence of Acute Global Malnutrition in Niger has fluctuated but remains above the alert threshold of ten percent and close to the WHO emergency threshold of 15 percent.|MDRNE019
6909|Due to recurrent food crises in Niger, the number of children and pregnant or nursing mothers in need of humanitarian assistance is increasing, according to the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT).|MDRNE019
6910|The causes of malnutrition in Niger are complex, multi-sectoral and interconnected: inadequate quantity and quality of food, difficult access to basic health services and drinking water, environmental sanitation, and so on.|MDRNE019
6911|All this is compounded by certain cultural practices (early weaning, lack of dietary diversity, etc.).|MDRNE019
6912|Often present at the same time, these factors create a vicious circle leading to under-nutrition.|MDRNE019
6913|The recent smart survey carried out between November and December 2017 shows a prevalence of acute malnutrition of 13.9% for the Diffa region with fairly marked disparities at the departmental level.|MDRNE019
6914|The departments of Mainé-Soroa (16% of MAG), Goudoumaria (14.4% of MAG) and N'Gourti (13.5% of MAG) are the most affected with prevalence that are between the emergency threshold and criticism of WHO.|MDRNE019
6915|However, there is an improvement in the prevalence of malnutrition between 6 and 40% for the departments of Diffa, Bosso and N'Guiguimi compared to the results of the EFSA survey conducted in August 2017.|MDRNE019
6916|In Niger, access to safe drinking water and sanitation remains relatively low.|MDRNE019
6917|According to WHO and UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation, estimates on the use of water, sanitation and Hygiene in 2015, at the national level, 46 percent of the population of Niger have access to basic water service, 42 percent have access to unimproved water point and two percent consumes surface water.|MDRNE019
6918|In rural areas (where more than 82 percent of the national population lives), the rate of access to basic water point is 36 percent, that is, less than one in two Nigeriens living in this environment has access to drinking water.|MDRNE019
6919|As for access to sanitation in Niger, in the rural areas only five percent benefit from safely managed latrines, against nine percent in urban areas.|MDRNE019
6920|Seventy-one percent of the Niger population uses open defecation.|MDRNE019
6921|It should however be noted that sanitation in Niger is much more an individual issue.|MDRNE019
6922|Collective systems for the disposal of wastewater, rainwater and solid waste are non-existent in rural areas.|MDRNE019
6923|The State and its partners have invested more in the implementation of waste management systems (gutters, latrines, rubbish dumps, landfill) in the urban areas, but they are insufficient and very poorly exploited.|MDRNE019
6924|Efforts have been made in urban areas in the domain of sanitation, but much remains to be done.|MDRNE019
6925|The problem is much bigger in rural areas where only a few actions have been undertaken.|MDRNE019
6926|In addition to the food and nutritional crisis that affected the country, the negative effects of recurrent floods on communities and livelihoods has worsened the situation.|MDRNE019
6927|The precipitation of June and July 2017 caused severe flooding in several localities in the country, causing tens of thousands of disaster victims and significant losses of human and animal life.|MDRNE019
6928|According to the Niger Civil Protection Services, the estimated number of people affected by flood as of 20 October 2017 is 206,513 people including 56 deaths.|MDRNE019
6929|A great mobilization of inputs and resources was needed, including in sectors such as Health, WASH and Nutrition, Food Security and Education.|MDRNE019
6930|The period was also favourable to malaria peak period, malnutrition and the outbreak of epidemics, mainly cholera.|MDRNE019
6931|Damaged properties were estimated at 12,000 houses collapsed, 16,048 animals washed away by water and 9,804 hectares of crops destroyed.|MDRNE019
6932|All together these incidents affected 29,551 households in eight regions of the country.|MDRNE019
6933|With regards to the above map, the Dosso region was once again the most affected floods-area in the country with at least 73,050 people affected.|MDRNE019
6934|This has also contributed in the food security crises in the region.|MDRNE019
6935|With regards to the food security situation and in a bid to address the food crisis, the IFRC granted CHF 261,041 on 25 August 2017 to support Niger RC Society in providing food and nutrition through cash transfer programming (voucher modality) and carry out prevention activities for 13,130 people (2,020 households) to enable the affected population to survive and meet its immediate needs.|MDRNE019
6936|This DREF operation equally aimed at conducting an in-depth needs assessment to allow NS develop a long-term plan to address issues pertaining to the food crisis in Sahel region.|MDRNE019
6937|The operation was set to last three months but was extended for an additional two months through an Operations Update issued on 14 November 2017.|MDRNE019
6938|Indeed, this acknowledged the challenges, mainly in-country security constraints, encountered since the start of the DREF operation, causing delays in its implementation.|MDRNE019
6939|Some activities could not be completed as planned and the extension allowed for Niger Red Cross Society (NRCS) to complete the implementation of remaining activities.|MDRNE019
6940|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), AECID, the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRNE019
6941|On behalf of the Niger Red Cross Society (NRCS), the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) extends its gratitude to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRNE019
6960|From 26 to 27 August 2017, continuous rainfall resulted in extensive flooding, destruction of houses and loss of household belongings in several parts of Niger.|MDRNE020
6961|The floods affected all the eight administrative regions of the country, including Agadez, Diffa, Dosso, Maradi, Niamey, Tahoua, Tillabery and Zinder.|MDRNE020
6962|According to the rapid assessment carried out by the Niger Red Cross Society (NRCS) and the Government officials (Directorate of Civil Protection), as of 20th October 2017, at least 29,551 households (206,513 people) had been affected, with 12,000 houses destroyed.|MDRNE020
6963|It was equally reported that 56 people died as consequence of these floods with many others injured and thereafter referred to the Niamey national hospital and other regional hospitals for treatment.|MDRNE020
6964|In addition to the human casualties, the flood devastated at least 9,804 hectares of agricultural land with crops and some 145,115 kgs of stored food was washed out by water.|MDRNE020
6965|More so, livestock was severely affected, with 16,048 animals, including small ruminants, cattle & camel heads and chickens, perished due to the flood.|MDRNE020
6966|The most affected region was Dosso region with at least 10,590 people.|MDRNE020
6967|A detailed report provided by the Directorate of Civil Protection at the Ministry of the Interior indicated that in Agadez, at least 383 houses and 99 walls were either partially or completely destroyed and several personal belongings carried away by water.|MDRNE020
6968|Also, 503 wells were submerged.|MDRNE020
6969|In Dosso, 5 hectares of agricultural farm were also devastated, while in Maradi, 4 granaries and seven classrooms collapsed.|MDRNE020
6970|In Tahoua, at least 59 granaries, 60 shops, 76 walls and 4 classrooms were destroyed.|MDRNE020
6971|In Tillabery, 36 walls, 4 granaries, 299 houses partially destroyed, 20 bags of sugar washed away.|MDRNE020
6972|In Zinder, 9 wells submerged by floods water.|MDRNE020
6973|The flooding water also devastated 9,804 hectares of agricultural land (mainly in Agadez and Dosso), with crops and 823.18 tons of stored food.|MDRNE020
6974|As of the 30 August 2017, the displaced populations were being hosted by other family members.|MDRNE020
6975|However, by December 2017, some were still living in the open air and in the schools of the affected areas, increasing their exposure to the extreme weather conditions, as well as their risk to communicable and respiratory diseases.|MDRNE020
6976|In addition, water and sanitation infrastructures were submerged thus contaminated and heightening the risk of spread of waterborne diseases such as cholera.|MDRNE020
6977|Due to the above situation, Niger Red Cross Society requested support from the International Federation of Red Cross Societies through the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to assist the most vulnerable people.|MDRNE020
6978|Thus, on 12 September 2017, a DREF operation worth CHF 234,666 was granted to assist 5,600 people (800 households) in shelter, WASH and non-food items for 3 months.|MDRNE020
6979|The map below indicates the floods affected areas in the country.|MDRNE020
6980|On 11 December 2017, an operations update was issued, granting a no-cost one-month timeframe extension to this operation, thus taking the operation end date to 12 January 2018.|MDRNE020
6981|This extension was to enable completion of distribution of NFI and shelter kits.|MDRNE020
6982|Indeed, procurement was delayed by administrative formalities at the Niger Customs, since the needed NFI/ Shelter tool kits were requested from the IFRC warehouse in Las Palmas (Spain), in collaboration with the Regional Logistic Unit and the Sahel CCST Logistic Officer.|MDRNE020
6983|The items (NFI/ Shelter Kits) reached Niger on 29 November 2017, but since they were not all included in the list of authorized items of the Customs, IFRC trucks were blocked at the border with Burkina Faso.|MDRNE020
6984|Niger Red Cross Society and IFRC were able to solve these difficulties after an “ad hoc” meeting held at the Ministry of Planning on 07 December 2017, where authorization was granted to enter these items into Niger as of 08 December 2017.|MDRNE020
6985|Furthermore, due to previous problems between IFRC and the Niger Customs Unit (car fleet registration problems), IFRC anticipated and decided to “donate” these items to Niger Red Cross Society.|MDRNE020
6986|Indeed, these items were supposed to be sent to the IFRC Niger Country Office for handover to NS, however, Niger Customs administrative procedures delayed the delivery of items (Tarpaulins, shelter tool kits, blankets, and long-lasting Mosquito bet nets) to IFRC thus items were directly sent to NS on the field for distribution to be conducted.|MDRNE020

7094|Since the 2010 cholera epidemic which recorded 41,787 cases and 1,716 deaths, Nigeria has experienced recurrent outbreaks of cholera.|MDRNG020
7095|In 2014, according to the Cholera Regional Platform, Nigeria was the most affected country by cholera in west and central Africa – with 35,996 cases reported, which represented 39 per cent of all cases in the region.|MDRNG020
7096|The outbreak in Nigeria spread to neighboring countries, specifically: Chad, Cameroon and Niger.|MDRNG020
7097|In early 2015, 13 of 36 states recorded cholera cases, with Anambra, Kano, Rivers and Ebonyi states being the worst affected; By the end of April 2015, 2,108 cases had been reported, with 97 deaths with the CFR rate rising to 4.76%, causing extreme concern.|MDRNG020
7098|On 6 March, 2015, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) released CHF 174,228 from the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to support the Nigerian Red Cross Society (NRCS) respond to the needs of the affected population.|MDRNG020
7099|The DREF operation was intended to support 15,000 people (3,000 households) in Anambra, Kano and Rivers states, with health and care, water, sanitation and hygiene promotion activities; over a period of three months.|MDRNG020
7100|Following initial assessments, Kano state was removed from the DREF operation, as it was confirmed that there were no cases at the time of the assessment and the state Ministry of Health (MoH) indicated that they did not require any preparedness or response assistance; as such it was replaced with Ebonyi state, where an increase in cases had been reported.|MDRNG020
7101|In addition, the DREF operation also coincided with the Presidential and Governorship elections (on 28 March 2015), which had had implications on mobilization of volunteers for training due to security concerns, and thus caused delayed implementation of the planned activities.|MDRNG020
7102|In “Week 12” of the DREF operation, is was also identified that the epidemic had continued to spread with sporadic cases being reported, making it difficult to control.|MDRNG020
7103|On 11 June 2015 an Operations Update was issued to extend the timeframe of the DREF operation by two months (New end date: 6 August 2015) to enable the completion of the activities planned in the Emergency Plan of Action (EPoA) and intensify awareness raising given the continuation of the outbreak.|MDRNG020
7104|An additional CHF 26,566 was allocated (Total allocation: CHF 200,794) to support the extension of the activities planned.|MDRNG020
7105|The major donors and partners of the DREF include: the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID) the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRNG020
7106|The Nigerian Red Cross Society would like to extend many thanks to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRNG020
7126|The northern part of Nigeria is seated on the meningitis belt, which like other Sub African countries continue to experience cerebrospinal meningitis (CSM) during the dry season, where temperatures can go above 35 degrees Celsius.|MDRNG021
7127|In 1996 the country recorded about 109,580 cases with 11,717 deaths were recorded, followed by the one in 2003 (4,130 cases and 401 deaths) then in 2,008 (9,086 cases and 562 deaths) and in 2009, it recorded 9,086 cases and 562 deaths.|MDRNG021
7128|In 2017, most Local Government Authorities in the northern part of the country were affected with Neisseria meningitis type C for the first time.|MDRNG021
7129|These outbreaks occur in the dry season, due to low humidity and dusty conditions and usually ends with the onset of the rainy season.|MDRNG021
7130|Meningitis is an acute severe infection of the central nervous system (CNS) associated with significant morbidity and mortality.|MDRNG021
7131|Highest burden occurs in parts of sub-Saharan Africa known as the “Meningitis Belt”.|MDRNG021
7132|Meningitis is a serious viral or bacterial disease in which an outside layer of the brain or spinal cord becomes affected and swollen, and can lead to death of the patient.|MDRNG021
7133|Symptoms of the disease include neck stiffness, high fever, rash, headache, vomiting and confusion.|MDRNG021
7134|Neissera Meningitides C was the major cause of the 2017 outbreak in Nigeria.|MDRNG021
7135|The last major outbreak was in 2009 due to Meningitides A (Source: NCDC 2017).|MDRNG021
7136|The index cases of meningitis were reported in week 50 of 2016 and within a short time not less than 4,255 suspected cases were reported with 455 deaths with case fatality rate (CFR) of 10.7% from 128 Local Government Areas (LGAs).|MDRNG021
7137|Within that short while five States reached epidemic proportion.|MDRNG021
7138|These States were Zamfara, Sokoto, Kebbi, Katsina and Niger States.|MDRNG021
7139|However, the Red Cross chose to launch its Disaster Relief and Emergency Fund (DREF) operation in the most affected states in the north-western States which include Sokoto, Zamfara and Katsina.|MDRNG021
7140|As at July 2017, a total 14,518 cased reported and 1,166 deaths recorded with case fatality rate of 8%.|MDRNG021
7141|A rapid assessment was conducted in April to prioritize the needs of the affected population using RAMP.|MDRNG021
7142|The assessment considered beneficiary exposure to risks, age group most affected and the capacity of the affected families to cope.|MDRNG021
7172|Following the escalating spread and increase in caseload of the Lassa Acute Viral Hemorrhagic Fever affecting 21 states in Nigeria, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) supported the Nigerian Red Cross Society (NRCS) to launch a Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) operation for CHF 271,886 to support response in six most affected states.|MDRNG023
7173|The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) activated the National Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) on 22 January 2018, to coordinate the response of all emergency organizations and increase surveillance through collaborative response.|MDRNG023
7174|From 1st January to 8 July 2018, a total of 2,115 suspected cases were reported from 21 states.|MDRNG023
7175|Of these, 446 were confirmed positive with a Case Fatality Rate of 25.4%.|MDRNG023
7176|About 10 cases were recorded as probable and 1,652 were tested negative.|MDRNG023
7177|A total number of 115 deaths were recorded amongst the confirmed cases.|MDRNG023
7178|A total number of thirty-nine health care workers were affected since the onset of the outbreak in seven states –Ebonyi (16), Edo (14), Ondo (4), Kogi (2), Nasarawa (1), Taraba (1) and Abia (1) with ten deaths in Ebonyi (6), Kogi (1), Abia (1), Ondo (1) and Edo (1).|MDRNG023
7179|About 81% of all confirmed cases were from Edo (42%), Ondo (24%) and Ebonyi (15%) states.|MDRNG023
7180|Lassa fever national multi-partner, multi-agency Technical Working Group (TWG) at the EOC was responsible for the coordination of response activities at all levels.|MDRNG023
7181|Having identified a gap in community level surveillance, contact tracing and most evidently, risk communication and awareness, the Nigerian Red Cross Society, being an active member of the EOC, requested a DREF grant which was allocated on 17 March 2018 through an operation to scale up intervention to contain the spread of the Viral Haemorrhagic Fever and reduce the risk of transmission.|MDRNG023
7182|The NRCS achieved this through case finding, surveillance, vector control activities, risk communication and awareness raising as well as providing psychosocial support to the most affected population in the five hardest hit states, which include Bauchi, Taraba, Edo, Ebonyi and Ondo.|MDRNG023
7183|Oyo state was targeted for cross border awareness activities as there was a report of a case imported into Benin Republic and therefore, the need to intensify surveillance and case finding for early detection and response.|MDRNG023
7184|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), AECID, the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRNG023

7275|On 4 October 2017, Tropical Depression Nate affected the Caribbean coast, leading the Nicaraguan government, through SINAPRED, to declare a yellow alert throughout the country.|MDRNI007
7276|The storm caused heavy rain and floods mainly in the Northern Autonomous Caribbean Region and the Rivas, Jinotepe, Leon, Chinandega, Matagalpa and Juigalpa departments in the country’s central Pacific region.|MDRNI007
7277|No major damages were reported in the Caribbean communities; however, the storm arrived immediately after two weeks of continuous rainfall, causing flooding in low-lying areas and landslides.|MDRNI007
7278|The Nicaraguan Red Cross activated its Emergency Operation Centre (EOC), and it prepared its staff at the national and branch levels; it also activated its Monitoring and Information Commission to track situation reports from the Pacific Region departments of Rivas, Carazo, León and Chinandega and in the central regions of Matagalpa and Juigalpa.|MDRNI007
7279|On 7 October 2017, SINAPRED reported that 16 people died, 682 affected communities in 14 departments, 5,952 damaged homes and 29,110 people were affected (6,848 families), of which 221 families were in collective centres.|MDRNI007
7280|Twenty volunteers from the branch in Rivas, along with support from a volunteer from the headquarters, carried out damage and needs assessments in the communities of Ochomogo and Gil González (Rivas department); additionally, National Society personnel evacuated people from flooded homes and provided immediate assistance to the most affected.|MDRNI007
7281|A water and sanitation team from the Nicaraguan Red Cross (NRC) was deployed, and conducted rapid assessments in health, water and sanitation, including chemical analysis of water sources and wells; approximately 432 families were affected, and 87 wells were flooded and contaminated in Rivas.|MDRNI007
7282|NRC volunteers provided psychosocial support (PSS) and surveyed the families in the collective centres in the Ochomogo community, Belén municipality, Rivas department).|MDRNI007
7283|After Tropical Storm Nate passed, the Regional Committee for Disaster Prevention, Mitigation and Response for the North Caribbean (COREPRED for its acronym in Spanish) lifted the tropical storm alert, deactivated the collective centres and allowed people to return to their homes.|MDRNI007
7353|This operation responded to the movement of Cuban nationals through Panama.|MDRPA011
7354|This population movement, which began in mid-November 2015, has involved passage through Ecuador and Colombia and continued unabated throughout the duration of this operation.|MDRPA011
7355|This constant influx of migrants has led to a situation in which the Red Cross Society of Panama (RCSP) continues to provide humanitarian support following the end of this DREF operation.|MDRPA011
7356|The migration flows were affected by the closure of the Nicaraguan border in November 2015 and the Costa Rican border the following month in December 2015.|MDRPA011
7357|The National Society worked to adapt to the changing humanitarian needs of this population.|MDRPA011
7358|The wave of migrants arriving in Paso Canoas increased concurrently with the departure of other migrants from Puerto Obaldía and the arrival of other migrants who had been in Panama City in the Chiriquí province.|MDRPA011
7359|Flights to Mexico departed from the Chiriquí province, which increased the flow of migrants into the province.|MDRPA011
7360|The Costa Rican Red Cross issued an emergency appeal (MDRCR014) for the population movement in Costa Rica; it is planned that part of the CHF 602,895 budget will support the Red Cross Society of Panama’s humanitarian actions on the Panamanian – Costa Rican border.|MDRPA011
7361|Following migrants’ departure from Puerto Obaldía and arrival in Paso Canoas due to the closing of the Nicaraguan and Costa Rican borders, the National Society was required to adapt to the changing scenario and humanitarian needs.|MDRPA011
7362|In line with the plan of action for this operation, the RCSP distributed water, water purifiers and personal hygiene kits (modified from those for families to individual migrants) and provided psychosocial support (modified from the initial plan for children to better attend adult needs).|MDRPA011
7363|The uncertainty regarding their future, financial constraints to remain in the waiting regions (Puerto Obadía) for extended periods and other factors have generated stress and challenges to their mental health.|MDRPA011
7364|Information on the situation of migrants was transmitted to the RCSP soliciting its help in compliance with its auxiliary role to the State on humanitarian issues.|MDRPA011
7365|Psychosocial support (PSS) workshops began, as well as individual psychological care for some of the migrants.|MDRPA011
7366|Furthermore, HIV-positive people identified themselves and assistance was provided so they could continue their medication.|MDRPA011
7367|After having delivered the care provided for in the emergency plan of action, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) learned that the flights to Mexico would begin as of 28 February 2016.|MDRPA011
7368|The uncertainty experienced by the migrants was significant, especially those whose statuses remained unclear due to their lack of resources to purchase airline tickets.|MDRPA011
7369|Some engaged in informal employment to earn some travel money.|MDRPA011
7370|Sufficient food that met minimum standards was another challenge since in Paso Canoas only the National Society, Caritas, SENAFRONT, and Panama’s Immigration Service directly provided food.|MDRPA011
7371|By 20 April 2016, 2,500 Cubans were in Paso Canoas, with an average of 100 arriving daily from Puerto Obaldía, which further strained already limited resources. .|MDRPA011
7372|The proliferation of mosquitoes led to health authorities issuing a national alert.|MDRPA011
7373|As a result, fumigation and cleaning campaigns commenced throughout the country.|MDRPA011
7374|Panama reached an agreement with Mexico in late January 2016.|MDRPA011
7375|As part of this agreement, Panama's Immigration Service provided a list of 1,301 Cuban nationals, but in reality this amount rose by 30 per cent in Paso Canoas, without taking into account those who were en route from Puerto Obaldía.|MDRPA011
7376|To date, nine Cubans are reported to have remained in Paso Canoas; the Panamanian government has issued them humanitarian visas.|MDRPA011
7377|Panama has closed its main border posts with Colombia (Darien and Puerto Obaldía) and with Costa Rica to Cuban migrants.|MDRPA011
7378|Since the border closure, there have been reports of an influx of Cuban migrants and hundreds of Cubans are currently stranded on the Colombia side of the border region.|MDRPA011
7384|Beginning on 12 November 2016, a tropical wave formed in the south-western Caribbean Sea near Panama’s coast.|MDRPA012
7385|Tropical Depression Otto formed in the early morning hours of Monday, 21 November 2016 in the southern Caribbean and later it became a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale on Tuesday, with sustained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)’s National Hurricane Centre.|MDRPA012
7386|That same Tuesday, 22 November, Panama’s President placed the country under alert to prepare all its national response organizations for the emergency, and schools were closed by presidential decree throughout Panama on Wednesday, 23 November 2016; however, they reopened the following day, except for some schools in the provinces of Colon and Bocas del Toro that were damaged by the storm.|MDRPA012
7387|The flooding caused by Hurricane Otto resulted in three deaths and at least four disappearances in Panama.|MDRPA012
7388|Severe flooding and landslides were reported in the provinces of Panama, Panama Oeste, Bocas del Toro, Colon, Chiriquí and Bocas del Toro, damaging houses and leading to blocked and collapsed roads.|MDRPA012
7389|The National Civil Protection System (SINAPROC for its acronym in Spanish) monitored all the areas that were affected by the flooding through its national emergency operations centre (NEOC).|MDRPA012
7390|Moreover, the Ministry of Health (MINSA) provided daily health promotion and vector control programming throughout the country during the emergency.|MDRPA012
7421|On 23 March 2015, flash floods and landslides, which are recurring events in the country, affected the central highlands in Peru.|MDRPE008
7422|Due to the geomorphology of the area, landslides occurred and affected several homes.|MDRPE008
7423|The following creeks experienced raised water levels and flooded surrounding areas: Pedregal, Carossio, Rayos del Sol, Quirio, San Antonio, California, La Trinchera, Buenos Aires, La Cantuta, Moyopampa, La Libertad and Mariscal Castilla.|MDRPE008
7424|The Lurigancho-Chosica district in Lima province was the first area to be severely affected from this flooding.|MDRPE008
7425|At about 17:30 hours that same day, heavy storms activated the Cashahuacra, Tres Cruces, Las Monjas, Cuculi, Rayos del Chingolay, Acopaya and Pomaticla creeks in the Santa Eulalia district, as well as the 9 de Octubre and Cupiche creeks in the Ricardo Palma district and the Buenos Aires creek in the Santa Cruz de Cocachacra district, causing landslides that affected homes and roads in the Huarochirí province, primarily in the Santa Eulalia district.|MDRPE008
7426|On 25 March, the national government declared a 45-day state of emergency in the Lurigancho-Chosica district in Lima province.|MDRPE008
7427|This event caused damage to lives, health, housing and roads.|MDRPE008
7428|The lower levels of dwellings in Carossio, Rayos del Sol, Buenos Aires and Moyopampa, the areas most affected by the landslide, were completely covered with mud, and public transport vehicles were trapped in material dragged by the landslide.|MDRPE008
7429|According to reports, 9 people were killed, 55 were injured, and 4,700 suffered damages to their homes in Chosica and Santa Eulalia.|MDRPE008
7430|A total of 207 dwellings collapsed; 154 were rendered uninhabitable; and 51 suffered damages.|MDRPE008
7431|The following table summarizes the impact, based on National Institute for Civil Defence data, up to 6 May in Santa Eulalia and 8 May in Chosica: The DREF was replenished by DG ECHO and the Belgian Red Cross/ Belgian government.|MDRPE008
7432|The major donors and partners of the DREF included the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID) the Medtronic, Zurich and Coca Cola Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRPE008
7433|The IFRC, on behalf of the Peruvian Red Cross would like to extend many thanks to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRPE008
7449|The intense rains, which began falling in early April, affected the populations living near the rivers.|MDRPE009
7450|According to INDECI's latest consolidated report, 33 districts across Loreto were affected, affecting 29,481 families (147,405 people), damaging 29,166 homes, rendering 336 homes uninhabitable, causing 2 to collapse, and damaging 672 educational institutions.|MDRPE009
7451|In terms of agriculture, 6,982 hectares of crops were destroyed and 2,215 hectares were affected.|MDRPE009
7452|Given the situation, a state of emergency was declared via Supreme Decree No. 028 2015 PCM in several districts in the provinces of Alto Amazonas, Loreto, Maynas, Requena and Ucayali.|MDRPE009
7453|Maynas was among the most affected provinces, accounting for 37 per cent of the damage in the entire region, affecting 36,327 people (10,857 families) in 10 districts, 10,542 homes and 1,818 hectares of crops; a total of 301 homes were also damaged.|MDRPE009
7454|Authorities set up 11 collective centres to house 2,101 people in Belén, Punchana and San Juan Bautista.|MDRPE009
7476|In May and September 2015, meteorological phenomena causing low temperatures and frost affected Andean regions 3,500 meters above sea level, with temperatures dropping to below 0°C accompanied by hail and snowstorms.|MDRPE010
7477|In some locations, temperatures plummeted to -15° C, severely affecting the lives and health of the population, as well as basic services, livelihoods (livestock and agriculture), different types of infrastructure and schools, among others.|MDRPE010
7478|On 19 July 2015, the government Executive Decree DS 050-2015 PCM declared a 45-day state of emergency for districts and provinces in the departments of Apurímac, Ayacucho, Arequipa, Cusco, Huancavelica, Lima, Moquegua, Pasco, Puno and Tacna.|MDRPE010
7490|On 14 August 2016, a 5.3 earthquake (on the Richter scale) struck Peru, affecting the province of Caylloma.|MDRPE011
7491|The epicentre was in Chivay, Arequipa at a depth of 8km.|MDRPE011
7492|According to the National Civil Defence Institute’s 28 November report, the earthquake left 4 people dead, 67 injured and 10,092 homeless and affected, and caused 136 dwellings to collapse, rendered 953 uninhabitable and damaged 1,802 dwellings and 12 schools; the destruction was mainly due to the 'shallowness' of the quake, the geological fault, the type of housing (adobe, which is mud and straw, and pirca, which is stone and mud) and the fact that many of the impacted houses were old.|MDRPE011
7493|In Caylloma, the affected districts included Ichupampa, Chivay, Achoma, Cabanoconde.|MDRPE011
7494|Yanque, Coporaque, Maca, Madrigal, Tapay, Huambo and Lari.|MDRPE011
7495|Per Peru's Geophysical Institute (IGP), 36 aftershocks were recorded after the earthquake, many of which caused landslides that blocked access roads; this situation caused significant concern and stress among the population.|MDRPE011
7496|On 16 August 2016, the government declared a 120-day state of emergency in the affected areas.|MDRPE011
7497|In addition, there was increased activity from the Sabancaya Volcano during the operation, triggering other earthquakes, volcanic explosions and spewing ash, which also caused concern among the affected families.|MDRPE011
7537|On 15 September 2015, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) supported the Papua New Guinea Red Cross Society (PNGRCS) through the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) allocation, to deliver humanitarian aid to families affected by the frost and drought resulting from the El Niño effect.|MDRPG005
7538|The operation experienced some challenges in implementation, including visa difficulties for the food security team leader, security issues, and delays while negotiating with communities for safe access.|MDRPG005
7539|As a result the operation was extended for three months to allow sufficient time to implement the activities.|MDRPG005
7540|The DREF operation has been successful on a number of levels: The operation fully reached its target outcome, in total some 3,012 households (16,566 people) were reached with hygiene promotion and jerry cans.|MDRPG005
7541|The DREF operation has built the capacity of the Mt Hagen branch of PNGRCS in a number of core areas including assessment, hygiene promotion, distribution, monitoring and beneficiary communications.|MDRPG005
7542|Off the back of the operation, the Mt Hagen branch has launched a volunteer recruitment drive.|MDRPG005
7543|The operation has also built the capacity and confidence at PNGRCS headquarters and the four branches that participated in the hygiene promotion training (facilitated by Touching the Untouchable).|MDRPG005
7544|As a result of this DREF operation, PNGRC has built partnerships with Care International and Touching the Untouchable, a local hygiene promotion NGO and has the opportunity to develop these relationships further.|MDRPG005
7545|The DREF operation recognized the need to train women hygiene promoters to reach the target communities and as a result, 55 women have been trained and empowered.|MDRPG005
7546|The women will take these skills and confidence back to their own communities.|MDRPG005
7547|The DREF operation has highlighted the good cooperation between PNGRC, the IFRC and the ICRC in Papua New Guinea.|MDRPG005
7548|This DREF received major contribution from the European Commission Directorate-General Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (DG ECHO).|MDRPG005
7549|The IFRC, on behalf of the Papua New Guinea Red Cross, would like to extend its appreciation to all partners for their continued support.|MDRPG005
7550|The DREF operation concluded on 15 March 2016, and a preliminary final report was issued on 14 June 2016.|MDRPG005
7551|The total final expenditure recorded under this operation is CHF 137,092.|MDRPG005
7552|< see attached financial statement >.|MDRPG005
7553|The unspent balance of CHF 13,577 will be returned to the DREF.|MDRPG005
7583|On 23 August 2017, the first case of measles was reported in the Vanimo Green District (VGD) of West Sepik Province in North-West Papua New Guinea (PNG), near the border with Indonesia.|MDRPG006
7584|By 31 October, 57 cases had been reported, with eight confirmed by laboratory tests and two deaths.|MDRPG006
7585|Figure 1 below shows the affected and immediate-risk districts identified by the NDoH and the National Measles Outbreak Taskforce for immediate action.|MDRPG006
7586|A measles outbreak was ongoing in areas of neighbouring Indonesia directly adjacent the Vanimo Green District.|MDRPG006
7587|The high mobility of people along this border may have resulted in the transmission of measles to PNG.|MDRPG006
7588|Further increasing the risk is the low vaccination coverage rates on the Indonesia border.|MDRPG006
7589|The government provided vaccinations at the official border crossing; however, this measure has not been done in other border crossings.|MDRPG006
7590|From late 2013 to 2014, a nationwide measles outbreak occurred in PNG.|MDRPG006
7591|The outbreak started in the same province and rapidly spread, making its way into Solomon Islands and Vanuatu over an eight-month period.|MDRPG006
7592|In 2014, 54 per cent of the reported cases occurred among children under the age of 5 and 12 per cent occurred in children between the ages of 5 to 9.|MDRPG006
7593|This is a similar age distribution to what was seen in the current outbreak.|MDRPG006
7594|More than 365 measles deaths were reported by the end of December 2014 with the case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.46 per cent.|MDRPG006
7595|In 2014, the outbreak was contained with only 49 of 3,469 suspected measles cases tested with no lab-confirmed cases.|MDRPG006
7596|Given this history, the National Department of Health and the National Measles Outbreak Taskforce wanted to ensure the quickest possible containment of cases and hence declared an outbreak.|MDRPG006
7597|Due to the remarkably low (14 per cent) indicator for laboratory confirmation, alongside incomplete or partially available data on epidemiological linkage, there was a very high chance of clinical measles-compatible cases.|MDRPG006
7598|However, given the context, all cases were labelled as “suspected measles” and a blanket campaign was launched to contain the outbreak within certain districts in the province.|MDRPG006
7599|The last case of measles for this latest outbreak was confirmed on 19 October 2017.|MDRPG006
7600|After a period of 30 days with no further reports of outbreaks, the National Department of Health and the National Measles Outbreak Taskforce declared an end to the outbreak on 28 November 2017.|MDRPG006
7601|A mass vaccination campaign had commenced in Sandaun Province, focusing on the areas where cases were confirmed.|MDRPG006
7602|With that, improved cold chain1 capacities were put in place.|MDRPG006
7603|Initially there was very poor operational cold chain facilities in the remote locations where cases were detected.|MDRPG006
7604|The cold chain coverage stood at no more than 10 per cent within the Vanimo-Green District area.|MDRPG006
7605|UNICEF assisted to ensure adequate cold chain in the affected areas by installing new refrigerators in designated health facilities.|MDRPG006
7606|Measles vaccines, as well as vaccines for routine immunization programmes, were transported and made available to launch regular vaccination campaigns.|MDRPG006
7607|However, the District Health Manager for Vanimo-Green received information that a number of children under 15 years of age in three areas of Vanimo Green district were left out of the campaign.|MDRPG006
7608|As such, it was decided to launch a “mop-up” vaccination campaign in those areas.|MDRPG006
7609|The District Health Manager requested the involvement of PNGRCS to support the awareness campaign.|MDRPG006
7610|The target population for measles mop-up campaign was children between 6 months and 15 years of age in three areas of Vanimo-Green District.|MDRPG006
7611|Following the mass vaccination campaign, Rapid Convenience Monitoring (RCM) was conducted in Vanimo-Green district.|MDRPG006
7612|Twenty household in each of the three areas (Lote, Vanimo urban and Ossima) were randomly selected to assess coverage of the target group (6 months – 15 years).|MDRPG006
7613|As Ossima area has an overall immunisation rate of 29 per cent, a RCM was not done here, instead the area was immediately prioritized for inclusion in the measles mop-up campaign.|MDRPG006
7614|Results of the RCM revealed coverage of 77 per cent for measles in Vanimo urban catchment and 83 per cent in Lote catchment.|MDRPG006
7615|The District Health Manager requested PNGRCS volunteers to focus on social mobilization and awareness in these three areas to precede and support the health department’s mop up immunisation schedule commencing on 27 November 2017.|MDRPG006
7616|Throughout the outbreak period the highest (46 per cent) number of cases were found to have occurred amongst children between the ages of 1 to 5 years.|MDRPG006
7617|All 57 cases were reported as “suspected measles” during the 3-month period after having developed rashes, with the peak onset date on 14 September 2017.|MDRPG006
7618|This was when the outbreak was on the rise and affected the whole of the Walsa Local Level Government (LLG), after index cases were identified in the Vanimo Urban LLG and the Green River LLG.|MDRPG006
7634|The remote Kadovar Island volcano became active on 5 January 2018 with mild volcanic activity on the south-eastern side of the island.|MDRPG007
7635|The Governor’s office conducted an aerial assessment and observed lava flow on the island with an estimated 50-60 per cent of the island covered in lava.|MDRPG007
7636|The entire population then was relocated to Blup Blup Island, which is an island of about 800 people.|MDRPG007
7637|By 6 January, prevailing wind conditions had carried ash clouds west of Kadovar Island.|MDRPG007
7638|Kadovar (Kadowar) is a small island belonging to the cluster of islands referred to as Schouten Islands.|MDRPG007
7639|Kadovar is approximately 100km from Wewak (line of sight) and 24km to nearest point on mainland East Sepik province.|MDRPG007
7640|Kadovar is part of Wewak Island Rural LLG in Wewak District, East Sepik Province.|MDRPG007
7641|Accordingly, the Wewak district administration worked with the East Sepik provincial administration and the member of parliament (MP) for Wewak to organize an evacuation.|MDRPG007
7642|The population of Kadovar were evacuated to Blup Blup Island on 12 January and they received initial support from the provincial government and PNG defence force.|MDRPG007
7643|They were then moved to the Dan Dan care centre (south of Wewak) from 14-17 January 2018.|MDRPG007
7644|Dan Dan Care Centre|MDRPG007
7645|The total number of people affected in Kadovar Island was 736, who were self-evacuated to Blup Blup Island.|MDRPG007
7646|Later PNG government moved all of them from Blup Blup Island to be re-settled in Dan Dan Care Centre.|MDRPG007
7647|However, a number of the affected population chose to move to other locations with their relatives/wontalk3.|MDRPG007
7648|There were a total of 557 affected people registered at the Dan Dan Care Centre.|MDRPG007
7649|This comprises of five community groups, the villages of Manot, Taragauo, Dong Sarakbano, Niukatnam and Rumgio, with a total of 145 families.|MDRPG007
7650|The care centre was quite well organised given the short amount of time and limited resources.|MDRPG007
7651|Each community has its own designated area within the total space of this site.|MDRPG007
7652|The care centre occupied a flat area in a small bay surrounded by large hills that is approximately 3.2 hectares in size.|MDRPG007
7653|The area is subject to being flooded by either king tides or large rainfall and runoff from the surrounding hills.|MDRPG007
7654|Due to the confined space, multiple families shared tarpaulins as there is not enough land for individual family sites.|MDRPG007
7655|Most families have raised platforms off the ground for sleeping.|MDRPG007
7656|Walking paths have been made along the front and back of the camp with small trails between tarpaulin tents within each community area.|MDRPG007
7657|Each community area is identified by signs at the entrance to their area.|MDRPG007
7658|There are limited pit latrines per village area and very limited natural water supply from creeks at either end of the site.|MDRPG007
7659|There is one generator in the location controlled by government officials with one large flood light to provide lighting.|MDRPG007
7660|None of the communities have access to individual or community lighting within their tents, in communal areas or for using latrines at night.|MDRPG007
7661|It is anticipated that the affected population will remain at the Dan Dan care centre for the next six months before being resettled at a larger permanent site where they will be able to build houses and re-establish their communities.|MDRPG007
7662|This requires the Provincial Government to finalize details with the host community that is providing land and ensure that payment is made to the community for the land before the population of Kadovar will be able to resettle permanently.|MDRPG007
7663|Due to the political nature of this decision process, it is extremely difficult to provide a prediction of how long this process will take in reality.|MDRPG007
7664|The affected population will require support for the entire time they are located at the care centre as they have no means of income generation or livelihoods as previously undertaken at their home in Kadovar Island.|MDRPG007
7665|Their movement from the area is also restricted with only limited boat access to the site.|MDRPG007
7689|A 7.5 magnitude earthquake with a 35-kilometre depth, struck at about 4 am (Papua New Guinea PNG time) on 26 February 2018, followed 30 minutes later by an aftershock of 5.5 magnitude, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS).|MDRPG008
7690|The epicentre was in the southern highlands in a mountainous area (Mount Bosavi) which is location with a mostly rural population; no major urban centres or infrastructure were located near the epicentre.|MDRPG008
7691|According to UNDAC reports, and based on the PNG 2011 census, a population of 37,689 persons live in the areas where the earthquake was most felt.|MDRPG008
7692|Approximately 270,000 people experienced the intensity above 6.0 and required humanitarian assistance.|MDRPG008
7693|The two most affected provinces were Hela and Southern Highlands.|MDRPG008
7694|The death toll remains unclear as of today, but it is believed that more than 100 people died, with most of confirmed deaths caused by landslides.|MDRPG008
7695|The majority of communication and road accessibility has returned to pre-earthquake status after being cut off for several weeks.|MDRPG008
7696|Some of the affected areas took weeks to be assessed as they could only be reached by air or walking in normal times.|MDRPG008
7697|The most remote locations could only be accessed by walking trails and in non-emergency periods lack radio or mobile networks.|MDRPG008
7698|As violent clashes in some of these communities ongoing phenomenon and quite frequent, the restriction of movement has delayed, or prevented, aid from reaching certain locations.|MDRPG008
7699|During this operation, several security incidents have occurred, which included the armed robbery of Papua New Guinea Red Cross Society (PNGRCS) volunteers and a regional disaster response team (RDRT) member.|MDRPG008
7700|On 14 June, in Mendi, the capital of Southern Highlands, was thrown into chaos following the angry mob attacked an Air Niugini Dash 8 aircraft, Court House and Governor Resident was torched and projectiles were exchanged between locals and security personnel.|MDRPG008
7701|For this reason, humanitarian organizations temporarily have suspended operations in Hela and later Southern Highland provinces.|MDRPG008
7702|Some of the final targeted people to be assisted could not be reached directly by our teams and those final distributions had to be delivered through community leaders as it was too risky for the PNRCS volunteers reach them directly.|MDRPG008
7748|On 25 June 2018, the National Department of Health declared a Polio Outbreak in Papua New Guinea and subsequently on 26 June 2018, the Papua New Guinea National Executive Council and Cabinet declared the polio outbreak as a National Public Health Emergency.|MDRPG009
7749|National Department of health priority was to response and prevent more children from being infected by the polio disease.|MDRPG009
7750|WHO, UNICEF and Health Department worked together with other partners including IFRC and PNG Red Cross Society (PNGRCS) to conduct a large-scale immunization campaign and strengthen surveillance system to combat the virus.|MDRPG009
7751|National Department of Health also collected stool specimens from family members of patients and the community in a “mop-up” immunization campaign targeting children.|MDRPG009
7752|A system was put in place to rapidly detect and identify cases of polio through enhanced surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP).|MDRPG009
7753|By 30 September since the confirmation of the outbreak, Papua New Guinea had reported 21 cases of polio in nine provinces including one in the National Capital District.|MDRPG009
7754|Last confirmed case had an onset on 18 October 2018.|MDRPG009
7755|On 29th June, the National Department of Health and WHO requested engagement from PNGRCS and IFRC to support the mobilization of volunteers for awareness raising and disease prevention activities.|MDRPG009
7756|This request was made during the polio outbreak urgent health cluster meeting.|MDRPG009
7757|There were three most high-risk provinces of disease transmission had been identified following the confirmed case of polio was found in Lae, Morobe province.|MDRPG009
7758|Due to low immunization coverage in another bordering province, Madang and Eastern Highland were also targeted for polio awareness and immunization which was started in July 2018.|MDRPG009
7759|"As WHO stated that the version of the virus circulating in the settlement is a ""vaccine-derived poliovirus"", meaning it is a mutated version of the weaker polio virus used in vaccinations."|MDRPG009
7760|Vaccine-derived polioviruses are rare and tend to occur in populations with very low vaccination rates.|MDRPG009
7761|They develop when unvaccinated children are in contact with the excrement of vaccinated children and are exposed to the weaker virus.|MDRPG009
7762|The WHO and PNG authorities launched an emergency immunization campaign to try to prevent other children from becoming infected.|MDRPG009
7763|Lae is the second largest city of PNG located in Morobe province.|MDRPG009
7764|Morobe province reportedly had a polio vaccination rate of 61 per cent prior to the outbreak.|MDRPG009
7765|PNG Health Authorities said 845 children had been immunized since the virus was first detected.|MDRPG009
7766|According to WHO the index case is a six-year-old boy from ‘4 mile’ settlement in Lae, Morobe, VDPV type 1 confirmed from the child’s stool confirmed by VIDRL (Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory) on 21 May 2018.|MDRPG009
7767|As per WHO guidelines, the total of 22 from Morobe and 20 from Eastern Highlands children in the index case community contacts were tested, to determine if the virus was circulating.|MDRPG009
7768|On 21 June, results received from lab that the same virus was found in two contacts in Lae.|MDRPG009
7769|This demonstrates that the virus was circulating in Lae, Morobe; however, missed transmission in other areas could not yet be ruled out.|MDRPG009
7770|On 22 June, the National, International Health Regulations (IHR) focal point of Papua New Guinea notified WHO of the index case of cVDPV1 and the confirmation cVDPV1 among two asymptomatic community contacts of the index case.|MDRPG009
7771|The Government committed PGK 6.7 million (CHF 2 million) to support outbreak response.|MDRPG009
7772|The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) provided initial supported to Papua New Guinea with USD 500,000 (CHF 497,000) for response activities.|MDRPG009
7773|On 27 June 2018, the National Department of Health activated the National Emergency Operations Centre and formed a National Emergency Response Team.|MDRPG009
7774|On 7 September 2018, one new case of polio had been confirmed in 6-year old boy from 5-mile settlement, Port Moresby.|MDRPG009
7775|This is first case reported from Port Moresby, the capital of Papua New Guinea.|MDRPG009
7776|The National Department of Health (NDOH) announced the finding after laboratory tests conducted by the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory, a World Health Organization (WHO) Polio Regional Reference Laboratory in Australia.|MDRPG009
7777|The United States Centre’s for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that this case was linked to the ongoing polio outbreak in the country.|MDRPG009
7778|By this date, Papua New Guinea had confirmed a total of 18 polio cases in the country affecting seven provinces: six in Eastern Highlands, three in Morobe, three in Enga, three in Madang, one in the National Capital District, one in Jiwaka and one in East Sepik.|MDRPG009
7779|A National Capital District campaign started on 24 September 2018 and continued nationwide for the 3rd and 4th rounds of vaccination.|MDRPG009
7858|A fire that reached the highest alarm1 broke out on 2 March 2015 in the densely-populated compound of Parola in Tondo in the Philippine capital, Manila.|MDRPH017
7859|More than 10,000 families (50,000 people) were affected, losing homes and essential household items.|MDRPH017
7860|More than 1,000 houses were destroyed or damaged by the fire.|MDRPH017
7861|Most of the affected people took refuge in evacuation centres set up by the city government of Manila.|MDRPH017
7862|The Philippine Red Cross (PRC), in part utilizing resources mobilized using the DREF allocation by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), supported the city government through provision of food, non-food items such as blankets, mosquito nets, sleeping mats, jerry cans and hygiene kits, and tarpaulins.|MDRPH017
7863|Of the total DREF allocation, CHF 72,125 was spent, and the balance of CHF 47,673 will be returned to the DREF pot.|MDRPH017
7877|Typhoon Maysak caused extensive damage as it came through the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) on 29 March 2015, heading west-northwest from the Pacific towards the Philippines.|MDRPH018
7878|Given the trail of destruction that Maysak had left in FSM, the authorities and humanitarian actors in the Philippines, including Philippine Red Cross (PRC), prepared for a possible humanitarian impact from the typhoon as the country braced itself for landfall.|MDRPH018
7879|However, on 5 April 2015, Maysak (known in the Philippines as Chedeng) made landfall as a tropical depression over Dinapigue, Isabela province, affecting the northern part of the country but causing much less damage than anticipated.|MDRPH018
7880|After the storm and following rapid assessments, it was verified that while people were affected, these were fewer and less severely than anticipated.|MDRPH018
7881|By 6 April, all families evacuated had returned to their homes.|MDRPH018
7882|As reported by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), the typhoon affected 2,761 individuals but caused no extensive damage.|MDRPH018
7883|In view of the scenario, the authorities and humanitarian actors did not have to mount a scaled up response.|MDRPH018
7884|As such only a portion of the financial resources that had been advanced to PRC from the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) was utilized in pre-positioning personnel, vehicles, supplies and equipment for response to the disaster.|MDRPH018
7885|Some relief assistance was provided to people pre-emptively evacuated and sheltered in evacuation centres.|MDRPH018
7886|Financial overview Total expenditure was CHF 3,970, translating to 20% of the revised operational budget.|MDRPH018
7887|A balance of CHF 16,315 remains and will be returned to DREF.|MDRPH018
7888|That will bring the total amount returned to DREF to CHF 115,210, i.e. including CHF 98,896 that was reduced from the initial allocation when the operational budget was reduced from CHF 119,180 to CHF 20,284 in the revised plan of action issued on 9 May 2015 .|MDRPH018
7889|<see attached financial report>|MDRPH018
7890|The IFRC would like to thank all partners and donors who contribute to DREF for their invaluable support.|MDRPH018
7910|On 18 October 2015, Typhoon Koppu (locally known as Lando) made landfall over the town of Casiguran, Aurora province, around 360 km northeast of Philippine capital, Manila.|MDRPH019
7911|A category 3 typhoon upon landfall, Koppu brought sustained winds of up to 185 km/h and gusts of up to 220 km/h.|MDRPH019
7912|The slow moving typhoon also brought 300 to 760 mm of rainfall over central and northern Luzon for 5 days, equal to one month’s worth of rainfall in some areas.|MDRPH019
7913|Koppu inundated many farmlands and destroyed crops and livestock.|MDRPH019
7914|The typhoon also damaged shelters, especially in the eastern coast of the Philippine.|MDRPH019
7915|Typhoon Koppu left 48 people dead, 83 injured and more than 3.13 million people (626,000 families) affected.|MDRPH019
7916|According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), more than 138,000 houses were damaged, with 19,000 totally destroyed.|MDRPH019
7917|The council also reported that more than 9 billion Philippine peso (PHP) (CHF 191 million) worth of agricultural produce and livestock were lost.|MDRPH019
7928|On 16 October 2016, at 2:30 AM, Typhoon Sarika (locally known as Karen) made landfall over Baler, Aurora with maximum sustained winds of 150 km per hour and gustiness of up to 210 km per hour, and moved west across the Luzon mainland before heading out to the sea west of the Philippines.|MDRPH021
7929|By morning of 17 October, Typhoon Sarika had exited the PAR, according to PAGASA.|MDRPH021
7930|At Sarika’s peak, Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal (TCWS) number 3 was raised in 11 provinces, TCWS number 2 in 10 provinces and Metro Manila, and TCWS number 1 raised in 12 provinces.|MDRPH021
7931|According to the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) report a total of 73,617 families (329,468 person) were affected in 1,491 barangays in Regions I, II, III, CALABARZON, V and CAR.|MDRPH021
7932|According to government data, 12,777 houses were damaged, of which, 11,356 are partially damaged and 1,421 are destroyed.|MDRPH021
7933|Furthermore, damage to agriculture sector amounted to PHP 3.6 billion (approximately CHF 74 million) while damage to infrastructure stands at around PHP 226 million (approximately CHF 4.6 million).|MDRPH021
7956|A magnitude 6.7 earthquake struck off the coast of north-eastern Mindanao, Philippines on 10 February 2017.|MDRPH024
7957|The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) reported that the earthquake was relatively shallow, with a depth of 10 kilometres, and its epicentre was about 16 kilometres from Surigao City.|MDRPH024
7958|The city is the capital of Surigao del Norte province with over 154,000 inhabitants.|MDRPH024
7959|After the earthquake struck, Surigao City was placed under a state of calamity on the 11 February.|MDRPH024
7960|On 13 February, the whole province of Surigao del Norte was placed under state of calamity.|MDRPH024
7961|The declaration allowed local governments to access calamity funds and to quickly procure necessary supplies.|MDRPH024
7962|According to National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), eight persons died and 249 injured due to the earthquake.|MDRPH024
7963|Based on DSWD Disaster Response Operations Monitoring and Information Center (DROMIC2) terminal report, there were 522 houses destroyed and 10,351 damaged due to the earthquake and the subsequent aftershocks.|MDRPH024
7964|A total of 47 school facilities were damaged.|MDRPH024
7965|There were 10,947 families or 54,735 persons displaced.|MDRPH024
7966|Electricity and water supply were badly affected.|MDRPH024
7967|Damage to infrastructure, including bridges, government offices, health and school facilities, irrigation system, and roads, has been estimated by the government at 719 billion Philippine pesos (PHP) or approximately 14 million Swiss francs (CHF).|MDRPH024
7980|Since 15 February 2017, there was a rapid increase in the number of Filipino returnees from the state of Sabah in Malaysia arriving in Zamboanga City, Mindanao.|MDRPH025
7981|Most of the returnees were coming from the eastern part of Sabah such as Semporna, Tawau, Lahad Datu, Kunak, Sandakan-Romero and Sandakan-Kumunak.|MDRPH025
7982|Previously, such repatriations were procedural and common place.|MDRPH025
7983|However, since September 2016 this process was suspended as the vessel used to transport people from the detention centres in Malaysia back to Philippines sank.|MDRPH025
7984|This lead to a large backlog of approximately 7,000 undocumented Filipino migrants in Sabah who were returned during a short period of time to clear the back log from February onwards.|MDRPH025
7985|Based on the assessment conducted by PRC at the ground level, aside from undocumented Filipino migrants, there were also stateless people who were part of the returnees.|MDRPH025
7986|Considering the humanitarian impact posed by a surge in repatriations, IFRC launched the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) on 31 March following Philippines Red Cross’ (PRC) request to support the immediate needs of the returnees.|MDRPH025
7987|The request was made after a dialogue between the PRC national headquarters, PRC chapters in Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi and Zamboanga City, local government counter parts and the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD).|MDRPH025
7988|Based on assessments conducted through key informant interviews with returnees, the immediate needs were identified as temporary accommodation, food, sleeping materials, hygiene items, medical support, psychosocial support and restoring family links.|MDRPH025
7989|Under this DREF operation, PRC’s support was on a one-off basis in view of the large scale of returnees’ needs following the backlog of repatriations.|MDRPH025
7990|Under normal circumstance, the National Society does not engage in providing significant welfare services to returnees in routine regular repatriations.|MDRPH025
7991|Any operations that do take place are supported by the chapters directly and within the national capacity.|MDRPH025
7992|The DREF was extended by two months, from 30 June 2017 to 31 August 2017.|MDRPH025
7993|The extension allowed the Zamboanga City PRC chapter to support the individuals who were not able to return within the initial timeframe of the operation due to issues of documentation and further problems in transportation.|MDRPH025
7994|Within the extended operational timeframe, of the 7,000 people expected to be part of the increase in repatriation, 4,658 returnees actually arrived in the country.|MDRPH025
7995|The majority of the back log is now cleared.|MDRPH025
7996|The balance of returnees still held in the detention centres in Malaysia will be repatriated under the normal process.|MDRPH025
7997|The repatriation activities still continue at a normal pace and the Philippine government continues to collaborate on the activity to support and reintegrate the returnees.|MDRPH025
7998|The chapter is constantly monitoring the arrival of returnees and have provided blood and ambulance services to the returnees even after the operation has ended.|MDRPH025
7999|The majority of the Filipino migrant returnees returned to their respective relatives and places of origin except those who are stateless in status.|MDRPH025
8000|Various Philippine government departments are supporting the gradual reintegration of these Filipino migrant returnees for their livelihood stability, political participation and social protection.|MDRPH025
8001|The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), in coordination with Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA), has initially assessed and coordinated with DSWD to provide skills training to the returnees.|MDRPH025
8002|To date, repatriation is still on-going.|MDRPH025
8003|The stateless persons are now staying in the DSWD Processing Center for Displaced Persons (PCDP) shelter in which they are provided with humane treatment and with basic commodities.|MDRPH025
8004|Prior to their deportation, in Malaysia, these people were requested to show legal documentation like national ID or birth certificate.|MDRPH025
8005|If they cannot show any documents, their citizenship was determined through their ascendants.|MDRPH025
8006|The Philippine government, through the DFA, will support these people with birth documentation.|MDRPH025
8028|Mayon Volcano is in Albay province in the Bicol region, around 300 km southeast of the Philippine capital, Manila.|MDRPH027
8029|On 13 January 2018, Mayon heightened activities, generating steam and ash.|MDRPH027
8030|As the day progressed, more phreatic eruptions occur, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHILVOLCS) raised Mayon from alert level I (abnormal) until alert level IV (hazardous eruption imminent).|MDRPH027
8031|On 16 January, the provincial board declared Albay under state of calamity, allowing local governments to use their calamity funds for relief operation.|MDRPH027
8032|An 8-kilometre extended danger zone was implemented when the alert raised to level IV.|MDRPH027
8033|Families within the radius were ordered to evacuate and seize activities.|MDRPH027
8034|NDRRMC reported on the total number of volcanic earthquakes and rockfall events.|MDRPH027
8035|The DSWD-Disaster Response Operations Monitoring and Information Center (DROMIC) reported that a total of 23,786 families or 91,055 persons in 61 barangays in Albay were affected by the phreatomagmatic eruption of Mayon Volcano.|MDRPH027
8036|On 29 March, the alert level status of the volcano was downgraded to Level II, allowing families to return to their homes.|MDRPH027
8058|The Philippine Red Cross Pangasinan chapter, which has its own blood center, remained operational since the onset of the flooding, even though the chapter building itself was submerged in floods throughout most of its emergency operations.|MDRPH028
8059|The chapter was able to deploy a search and rescue team to evacuate people in high-risk areas, as well as WASH and welfare teams to conduct health and hygiene promotions and give out hot meals inside the evacuation centers.|MDRPH028
8060|The combined effects of Tropical Storms Son-Tihn, Ampil and Tropical Depression Josie, which hit the Philippines within days of each other, worsened the Southwest Monsoon and dumped torrential rains and caused major flooding in northern and central Philippines.|MDRPH028
8061|17 July 2018: Tropical Storm Son-tinh (locally known as Henry) made landfall in Cagayan, northeast Philippines, enhancing the Southwest Monsoon (locally known as Habagat) affecting the country.|MDRPH028
8062|19 July: Severe Tropical Storm Ampil (locally known as Inday) enters Philippines Area of Responsibility (PAR) while it did not make landfall it further enhanced Southwest Monsoon.|MDRPH028
8063|21 July: Tropical Depression Josie, which formed inside the PAR and made landfall over north west of the Philippines further enhanced the south west monsoon, bringing more rain to already inundated areas.|MDRPH028
8064|Flood and landslides were reported, while more than one million people are affected across 21 provinces and seven regions.|MDRPH028
8065|29 July: DREF launched for CHF 287,870.|MDRPH028
8066|7 August: Tropical Depression Yagi (locally known as Karding), formed inside the PAR while it did not make landfall makes landfall over the east of the Philippines, it further enhances causing more rain as it further enhanced the Southwest Monsoon.|MDRPH028
8067|11 August: Metro Manila and Rizal provinces were put under the highest weather warning alert experiencing periods of intense rainfall.|MDRPH028

8707|On 18 September 2015, following the end of the DREF operation, an EA was launched, seeking 549,020 Swiss franc to support 10,000 people (2,000 families): specifically 7,500 people (1,500 families living in the Mahama camp and 2,500 people (500 families) living in the Munini host community, neighbouring this camp (separate from the people assisted through the DREF operation).|MDRRW012
8708|Please refer to the EA for information on this operation.|MDRRW012
8709|This DREF has been partially replenished by the Belgian Red Cross / Govt, Canadian Red Cross / Govt., DG ECHO and Netherlands Red Cross / Silent Emergencies Fund.|MDRRW012
8710|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID) the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRRW012
8711|The IFRC, on behalf of the Rwanda Red Cross Society would like to extend many thanks to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRRW012
8722|On 01 April 2017 at 3:00 pm, Gatsibo district located in the Eastern Province of Rwanda experienced heavy rainfall associated with heavy storms, which resulted in destruction of houses and community farm lands in Kiramuruzi Sector Nyabisindu Cell.|MDRRW014
8723|The affected area is located 36 kilometers from Gatsibo District, 40 kilometers from the Eastern Province office and 70 kilometers from the City of Kigali.|MDRRW014
8724|The preliminary assessment gathered by Rwanda Red Cross staff and volunteers, estimated that 675 people (135 households) were affected by heavy wind and storms.|MDRRW014
8725|Renewed assessments confirmed that the amount of people affected remained around 135 households.|MDRRW014
8726|The last performed assessment in June, showed that households were impacted in the following way:|MDRRW014
8727|Households with houses destroyed and living with host communities (N= 34 households)|MDRRW014
8728|Households living in their destroyed houses (with half a roof) (N= 57 households)|MDRRW014
8729|Households that have recovered their houses and are managing (N= 44 households)|MDRRW014
8730|Households that need roofing for latrines (N= 811 households)|MDRRW014
8741|Heavy rainfall and winds in the districts of Rusizi, Nyamasheke, Huye, Bugesera, Gicumbi, Ngoma, Kirehe, Rubavu and Nyabihu on 17 September 2017, resulted in destruction of houses and community farm lands.|MDRRW015
8742|The most affected areas were in five districts: Rusizi and Nyamasheke (Western province); Ngoma and Bugesera (Eastern province); and Huye (Southern province).|MDRRW015
8743|Rapid assessments conducted by RRCS staff and volunteers indicated that an estimated 5,460 people from 1,092 households were affected by heavy winds and out of these, 640 families were homeless and classified as most vulnerable.|MDRRW015
8744|The disaster caused three deaths and 24 people were injured.|MDRRW015
8745|The affected families were accommodated in the nearby communities after their homes were damaged and a variety of household materials, shelters and clothing destroyed, leaving the affected population without basic necessities.|MDRRW015
8746|Household bedding materials were also destroyed, creating the need for blankets, sleeping mats and other essential Non-Food items (NFIs).|MDRRW015
8747|It was reported that an estimated 1,024 hectares of mixed crops (including banana trees and cassava plants) were destroyed and household food stocks were completely damaged.|MDRRW015
8748|Latrines and other sanitation infrastructure was also destroyed, increasing the risk of a disease outbreak - 78 cases of AWD were reported in the Nyamasheke district between September and November 2017.|MDRRW015
8749|In October 2017, following an emergency needs assessment conducted by RRCS in the affected areas, IFRC launched a DREF operation for CHF 102,959 to support RRCS response to this situation.|MDRRW015
8750|The operation targeted 5,460 people (1,092 households) through hygiene promotion and community sensitization activities.|MDRRW015
8751|Of this total target, 3,200 most vulnerable people (640 HHs) were targeted with NFI distribution.|MDRRW015
8752|In addition to the above, RRCS and IFRC conducted a joint cash assessment in the 5 districts which were being targeted by the DREF.|MDRRW015
8753|As cash was identified in the operational plan as a strategy to deliver the assistance to affected households, the purpose of the assessment was to determine the capacity of local markets to provide the required shelter items, assess the risk of inflation, determine the cash transfer modality to be used and to determine the cash transfer value per household.|MDRRW015
8754|This assessment resulted in the review of the operational plan and an Operations Update No.1 was issued in December 2017 to increase the budget for CTP activities and the number of volunteers to be trained on AWD.|MDRRW015
8755|The update also allowed for the extension of the operation timeframe by one month to allow for implementation of these activities.|MDRRW015
8756|In February 2018, a no-cost extension was granted through Operations update No. 2.|MDRRW015
8757|The update extended the operation by one additional month (making the overall operational timeframe to five (5) months) to allow RRCS to monitor the usage of the cash.|MDRRW015
8758|Cash assistance was a new tool in the National Society that was being piloted in the DREF operation.|MDRRW015
8759|It was also new to local partners including the local government.|MDRRW015
8760|This required constant discussions with the local authorities in the different districts to ensure they understood it and fully accepted the distribution of cash, which delayed implementation.|MDRRW015
8761|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), AECID, the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRRW015
8762|On behalf of the Rwanda Red Cross Society (RRCS), the IFRC would like to extend its gratitude to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRRW015
8779|Beginning March 2018, heavy rainfall was experienced across many districts in the Western, Southern and Eastern regions of Rwanda, which resulted in flooding and landslides.|MDRRW016
8780|On 3 March 2018, Rubavu District, located in the Western province of Rwanda, experienced heavy rains which resulted in flooding along Sebeya River and landslides in the steep areas.|MDRRW016
8781|The affected areas were in four sectors, namely Nyundo, Nyakiliba, Rugerero and Kanama|MDRRW016
8782|In Rubavu district, 5,000 households (25,000 people) from seven (7) cells in four (4) sectors were affected by the floods, of which 4,750 people from 950 households were directly affected.|MDRRW016
8783|These 950 HH were accommodated in the nearby communities after their homes were either destroyed or damaged by flowing waters and mud debris.|MDRRW016
8784|Following the disaster, an emergency needs assessment was carried out in the seven (7) flood affected cells in the four (4) sectors in Rubavu district, in collaboration with the local authorities and the Ministry of Disaster Management and Refugees (MIDIMAR).|MDRRW016
8827|From August 2016, an unusual increase in dengue-like illness, including the number of confirmed Dengue cases, was observed through the National Syndromic Surveillance System of the Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MHMS) in the Solomon Islands.|MDRSB005
8828|An outbreak of dengue was declared by the Solomon Islands Government for Honiara city and the Guadalcanal province on 8 October 2016 and surveillance of dengue cases was increased by the Honiara City Council, other private practitioners and in the Guadalcanal province.|MDRSB005
8829|This was expanded to include Gizo township (Western province) and the Auki township (Malaita province) on 19 October 2016.|MDRSB005
8830|Between 15 August and 16 October 2016, a total of 1,212 suspected dengue cases were reported in Guadalcanal (including Honiara), Malaita and Isabel provinces (798 additional cases were reported in situation report #3 of the MHMS for the week of 10-16 October 2016) and at least three dengue-like illness cases reported for Gizo City in the Western Province.|MDRSB005
8831|In situation report #26 issued by the MHMS for week 121, 2017 of the Dengue outbreak, the MHMS advised that a total of 12,030 line-listed cases of suspected dengue had been reported across all 10 provinces of the Solomon Islands since week 332, 2016, and that 96% of the cases had been reported from the Honiara and Guadalcanal provinces.|MDRSB005
8832|To date, a total of 3,360 rapid diagnostic tests have been conducted.|MDRSB005
8833|Of these, 1,455 (44%) were positive for Dengue.|MDRSB005
8834|Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) was also detected in 35 out of 51 samples that were sent to the New Zealand Institute of Environmental Science and Research Limited (ESR) in December 2016.|MDRSB005
8835|The MHMS further reported a total 824 hospitalizations since week 33, 2016 within which 62% of the admitted cases were below 24 years of age.|MDRSB005
8836|From October 2016 until January 2017, 15 deaths were associated with the outbreak, 60% of which were in persons aged 50 years or older.|MDRSB005
8837|The MHMS advised a decrease in the weekly trend of reported dengue cases and that overall data indicated that the number of cases had decreased significantly indicating a possible slowing down of the outbreak.|MDRSB005
8838|The Ministry of Health Emergency Operation Committee (MHEOC) stood down its operation in mid-April 2017.|MDRSB005
8839|This decision was based on the epidemiological trend, which showed a consistent decrease in the number of cases from February 2017.|MDRSB005
8840|In addition, the current case load of dengue admissions to the National Referral Hospital (NRH) is manageable under routine operational capacity.|MDRSB005
8861|A 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit approximately 62km west-southwest of Kirakira in the Makira province of the Solomon Islands at 0439 hours on 9 December 2016.|MDRSB006
8862|The impact was strongly felt in Makira, south of Malaita, north of Guadalcanal and in Rennell and Bellona.|MDRSB006
8863|A tsunami was also observed in Makira.|MDRSB006
8864|In the several hours following the earthquake, the Solomon Islands experienced ten significant aftershocks ranging from 4.5m to 5.5m.|MDRSB006
8865|Following initial assessments, the National Emergency Operations Centre (EOC), in collaboration with the Provincial EOCs of the impacted provinces, narrowed the scope and scale of the disaster to Makira and South Malaita where the most significant impacts were felt.|MDRSB006
8866|Impacts in the Guadalcanal province were considered minimal.|MDRSB006
8867|The Solomon Islands government, its stakeholders and partners had immediately deployed relief items by boats to the impacted communities of Makira and Malaita.|MDRSB006
8868|Relief items included tarpaulins, shelter toolkits and water containers.|MDRSB006
8869|In addition, a Nomad water purifying unit, generator, water pump and 5,000-litre water bladder had been sent to Makira.|MDRSB006
8870|Initial government and Red Cross assessment data indicated an estimated 834 households (5,004 people) requiring non-food items (NFIs) assistance.|MDRSB006
8871|This figure was later revised to 765 households (4,590 people) at the time of distribution when technical teams comprising representatives of the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) and Red Cross had the opportunity to verify the needs in each province.|MDRSB006
8933|Between January May 2016, Seychelles experienced an exponential increase in the number of confirmed cases of dengue fever.|MDRSC004
8934|The outbreak was in all five regions of the country, with approximately 253 persons tested positive for dengue as from January up till 21 May 2016, as reported by the Ministry of Health.|MDRSC004
8935|More specifically there was an exponential increase in the number of confirmed cases from week 16 onwards with the peak (66 cases) in week 19.|MDRSC004
8936|In total 175 males and 96 females tested positive.|MDRSC004
8937|This trend was a gross underestimation of the real situation on the ground, which was much worse, since people who suffered the milder form of the disease were not seeking medical attention.|MDRSC004
8938|In the month of May, 75 cases were reported.|MDRSC004
8939|Every region on Mahé was affected, and more cases were being reported in the four districts of La Riviere Anglaise, Anse Royale, Anse Etoile and Beau Vallon, with one case in Praslin Island.|MDRSC004
8940|As of 12 July 2016, the Ministry of Health confirmed the total number of cases as 1,062, with the outbreak extending to all five regions of the country, the 5 most affected districts being La Riviere Anglaise, (101 cases), Anse Royal (99 cases), Anse Etoile (82 cases), Beau Vallon (78 cases) and Point La Rue (62 cases).|MDRSC004
8941|For more details see Operations Update no. 1 and the table below.|MDRSC004
8942|The revised operation objective was therefore to reduce the risk of spread of the dengue virus for 16,392 persons in the five most affected districts of Seychelles and sensitizing approximately 53,000 persons on dengue fever via radio programmes.|MDRSC004
8943|The majority of the baseline respondents preferred the use of repellent as opposed to using mosquito nets and their main reason for not buying repellent was the inhibitive cost and limited availability of repellent in Seychelles.|MDRSC004
8944|To this effect, the National Society procured and distributed repellent to the targeted population instead of mosquito nets.|MDRSC004
8971|A plague outbreak in Madagascar raised concern in neighbouring countries.|MDRSC005
8972|As of 12 October 2017, a total 684 cases (suspected, probable and confirmed) including 57 deaths (CFR 8.3%) had been reported from 35 out of 114 districts.|MDRSC005
8973|Of these, 474 were clinically classified as pneumonic plague.|MDRSC005
8974|On 16 October 2017, Madagascar Ministry of Health (MoH) reported that caseload that was at 805 (confirmed and suspected) with 74 deaths.|MDRSC005
8975|While Madagascar is accustomed to seasonal bubonic plague outbreaks, the current was characterised by a combination of pneumonic and bubonic plague.|MDRSC005
8976|Pneumonic plague, which counted 65% of the caseload, is transmitted from person to person and the fact that the majority of the cases occurred in urban areas made this outbreak a serious concern not only for Madagascar, but for the region.|MDRSC005
8977|Consequently, WHO classified the 2017 Plague outbreak in Madagascar as a grade 2 emergency, and WHO liaison officer expressed concern, considering Seychelles as a priority country, which needed emphasis on preparedness and stated that support can be provided.|MDRSC005
8978|Indeed, one Seychellois passed away in Madagascar after contracting the disease during a basketball tournament there in the early week of October.|MDRSC005
8979|On 10 October 2017, the Seychelles Ministry of Health notified WHO of a probable case of pneumonic plague.|MDRSC005
8980|The probable case was a 34-year-old man who had visited Madagascar and returned to Seychelles on 6 October 2017.|MDRSC005
8981|He developed symptoms on 9 October 2017 and went to a local health centre.|MDRSC005
8982|Based on a medical examination and reported history of recent travel to Madagascar, pneumonic plague infection was suspected and he was immediately referred to hospital where he was isolated and treated.|MDRSC005
8983|A rapid diagnostic test (RDT) performed within the country on 11 October 2017 on a sputum sample was weakly positive.|MDRSC005
8984|The specimen was sent to the WHO Collaborating Centre for Plague at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, France.|MDRSC005
8985|Between 9 and 11 October 2017, eight of his contacts developed mild symptoms and were isolated and treated.|MDRSC005
8986|Two other suspected cases, without any established epidemiological link to the probable case, were also identified, isolated and treated.|MDRSC005
8987|Laboratory results released by the Institut Pasteur in France on 17 October 2017 showed that all 10 specimens were negative for plague.|MDRSC005
8988|All the suspected cases were soon after discharged after completing their course of treatment.|MDRSC005
8989|At the time of the launch of this DREF operation, no plague cases had been confirmed in Seychelles.|MDRSC005
8990|Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis, zoonotic bacteria, usually found in small mammals and their fleas.|MDRSC005
8991|It is transmitted between animals through fleas.|MDRSC005
8992|Humans can be infected through: the bite of infected vector fleas, unprotected contact with infectious bodily fluids or contaminated materials and the inhalation of respiratory droplets/small particles from a patient with pneumonic plague.|MDRSC005
8993|In October 2017, nine countries and overseas territories were identified as high risk for plague outbreak by virtue of having trade and travel links to Madagascar.|MDRSC005
8994|These priority countries included Comoros, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, Reunion, Seychelles, South Africa, and Tanzania.|MDRSC005
8995|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), AECID, the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRSC005
8996|On behalf of the Red Cross Society of Seychelles (RRSS), the IFRC would like to extend its gratitude to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRSC005
9104|In Mid-June 2017, torrential rains and flash flooding affected more than 70,535 people (approximately 14,000 households) across 8 states in Sudan namely Khartoum, Northern State, Sennar, Kassala, River Nile, Gezira, West Kordofan and White Nile states.|MDRSD025
9105|According to the rapid assessment conducted by Sudanese Red Crescent Society, over 8,120 houses were destroyed and 5,987 houses partially damaged.|MDRSD025
9106|A total of 2,868 latrines collapsed putting community at risk of water borne diseases.|MDRSD025
9107|30 public institutions mostly schools were also affected.|MDRSD025
9108|At least 25 people were killed and 112 injured by the floods across Sudan since the start of the heavy rains.|MDRSD025
9109|Following these events, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) approved a DREF allocation of CHF 347,251 in August 28, 2017, for floods affected communities in Khartoum, River Nile and Northern States in Sudan.|MDRSD025
9110|In these areas, flash floods followed by heavy winds in localities of Halfa, Dalgo and Merawi led to collapsing and destruction of 561 houses, 12 institutions and 2 health centres.|MDRSD025
9111|In addition, 83 persons were injured and 11 reported dead in these areas.|MDRSD025
9112|The DREF operation aimed at providing emergency assistance and humanitarian relief to 2,000 households (10,000 people) affected by the 2017 floods disaster in these Counties.|MDRSD025
9113|This included provision of NFIs, health and care, hygiene awareness and sanitation campaigns.|MDRSD025
9190|Since the summer of 2015 Slovenia has been witnessing an increase in the number of migrants from Croatia on the Slovenian border, due to the rapidly changing migration route in the region.|MDRSI002
9191|The first larger groups of 278 migrants arrived at the Slovenian border with Croatia on 18 September 2015.|MDRSI002
9192|Since then, until 8 March 2016, when the Western Balkans Transit route has been shut down, in total 477,791 migrants have crossed Slovenia in search for international protection or better life in Western Europe countries.|MDRSI002
9193|The majority of the migrants arriving to Slovenia have been in transit since only a marginal number of people asked for international protection in Slovenia.|MDRSI002
9194|Since 18 September 2015, almost half a million people have passed through the country, usually staying in the country less than 24 hours.|MDRSI002
9195|At the peak of the influx, the reception centres were accepting more than 12,000 people every 24 hours.|MDRSI002
9196|During the first few weeks of migrant crisis in Slovenia, the situation in the field has been extremely challenging.|MDRSI002
9197|The sheer number of migrants crossing the country and in need of assistance, lack of experiences in state bodies and in humanitarian organizations about management of such large scale humanitarian disaster, lack of proper shelter items and equipment and diminishing stock of supplies in the warehouses of humanitarian organizations, have caused difficult conditions both for the migrants and for the persons, providing assistance to them.|MDRSI002
9198|The speed of the migrant flow additionally caused numerous challenges in terms of delivery of assistance, both in material and in non-material sense.|MDRSI002
9199|Already before the arrival of the migrants in Slovenia, the Slovenian Red Cross had been actively involved in order to respond to the population movement as part of the State Coordination Group for Disaster Response.|MDRSI002
9200|The State, under the coordination of the Ministry of Interior, has established five processing centres as part of the response plan in preparation of the potential increase in the number of arrivals at the border line close to Brežice, Rigonce, Obrežje, Dolga vas and Gruškovje.|MDRSI002
9201|After the registration of migrants in those five centres, migrants have been located in different accommodation facilities across the country where they could stay not longer than three days.|MDRSI002
9202|In addition, accommodation facilities across the country were identified, and the following locations were made completely ready to accept migrants for up to 3,140 people at one single time.|MDRSI002
9203|The locations and capacities of the accommodation centres are presented below, together with number of beds in each centre.|MDRSI002
9204|The Slovenian Red Cross with its staff and volunteers has been actively involved at all locations, providing 24/7 support of the migrants and support to the operations of centres.|MDRSI002
9205|The situation has, after the beginning of the crisis, significantly improved with the regards to logistical management of the migration flow, as the government has taken general responsibility to manage the process through the National Civil Defense System which has been activated in late September 2015, where Slovenian Red Cross has been involved in crisis management as a member at national and regional level.|MDRSI002
9206|At this level the division of responsibilities for certain activities has been decided upon, and, as a consequence, the logistical support to the migrants significantly improved, both in terms of availability of supplies and services and in terms of establishing more humane conditions for reception of migrants, their accommodation and support, the transportation in-country and during the transfer to Austria.|MDRSI002
9207|During the last stage of the crisis, the whole process was managed at two locations for transiting migrants, one at the entrance into Slovenia (Dobova), and the other at the exit point to Austria (Šentilj), with additional exit point in Jesenice for migrants transported with trains directly to Austria.|MDRSI002
9208|The migrants have entered the country in organized way at entrance point Dobova, in coordination with the Croatian government (this was not the case of first period of migrant crisis).|MDRSI002
9209|The transport was organized by the train from Croatia, and the passengers have then been transported with busses directly from railway station to Reception centre for registration and service.|MDRSI002
9210|Stricter registration procedures at the entrance point have been introduced during the crisis, and the evidencing of people required significant amount of time, sometimes causing the distress.|MDRSI002
9211|The migrants have then been assisted with the provision of food and accommodation at the reception centre facilities, where they had received services offered by the Slovenian Red Cross and other humanitarian actors.|MDRSI002
9212|The migrants have been settled at the reception centre until the transport arrangements have been completed.|MDRSI002
9213|Groups of migrants have then transported to Accommodation centre at exit point in Šentilj, where they were settled and assisted.|MDRSI002
9214|They had to stay in the centre until allowed to progress towards Austria; here Austrian Authorities processed the registration of every individual again.|MDRSI002
9215|During the 2016, number of people rejected by Austrian authorities grew steadily.|MDRSI002
9216|Additionally, the Slovenian Red Cross was present in accommodation centre Lendava, where migrants refused the entrance into Austria have been located.|MDRSI002
9217|Migrants who asked for the asylum in Slovenia have been relocated to other locations mainly to Asylum centre in Ljubljana and Vrhnika.|MDRSI002
9218|In beginning of 2016, the average number of entries in Slovenia was between 1,500 and 2,000 transiting migrants daily.|MDRSI002
9219|In March the numbers dropped significantly due to newly introduced strict policy on the West Balkans migrant route, which effectively closed the migrant route.|MDRSI002
9220|In February and March 2016 Austria, as key transit and important destination country, started to impose strict policy with the regards to migrants, followed by the same regulation introduced in Slovenia.|MDRSI002
9221|Changes are also imposed in Croatia, Serbia and Macedonia.|MDRSI002
9222|This effectively caused the closure of the migratory route through Slovenia, but has caused numerous problems for people found stranded in the countries of the way, especially in Greece.|MDRSI002
9230|Since early September 2015, the Bo, Bonthe, Freetown, Port Loko and Pujehun districts in the southern provinces of Sierra Leone experienced flooding due to torrential rains which led to widespread destruction.|MDRSL006
9231|As of 5 October 2015, according to the Government of Sierra Leone through the Office of National Security (ONS) the total affected population in the five districts has reached 24,303, with the summary as follows: Bo (3,293), Bonthe (4,650) and Port Loko (1,510), Freetown (14,050) and Pujehun (800).|MDRSL006
9232|In Freetown, an estimated 14,050 people were displaced and staying in the Attouga Mini Football Stadium and National Football Stadium; however the conditions in both of these sites were not satisfactory – with limited access to safe drinking water, poor sanitary facilities, and the risk of epidemic outbreaks (Acute Watery Diarrhoea (AWD), cholera, Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) etc.).|MDRSL006
9233|In the Bo, Bonthe, Port Loko and Pujehun districts, people have evacuated to nearby communities, seeking refuge with relatives or in public buildings (government buildings, mosques, schools etc.).|MDRSL006
9234|In many of the more remote affected communities, assistance had not reached the affected population, leaving them exposed to the continuing rains.|MDRSL006
9235|On 14 September 2015, the GoS appealed to humanitarian organisations to help in assisting the affected population.|MDRSL006
9236|On 18 September 2015, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) released CHF 88,050 from the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to support the Sierra Leone Red Cross respond to the needs of 2,630 people (567 families), affected by flooding in Bo and Pujehun districts for a period of three months, specifically in the areas of health and care, shelter and settlements, water, sanitation hygiene promotion.|MDRSL006
9237|On 12 October 2015, Operation update no 1 was issued and additional allocation of CHF 196,950 was approved bringing a total allocation of CHF 285,000 for the DREF Sierra Leone floods operation to enable the Emergency Plan of Action (EPoA) to expand its activities to meet the needs of families in the city of Freetown (East End and West End), and the chiefdoms of Bonthe and Port Loko, which were also experiencing extensive flooding.|MDRSL006
9238|In total, 24,303 beneficiaries/people i.e. (4,051 households) were reached through this DREF operation.|MDRSL006
9239|Operations update no 2 was issued on 18 December 2015 to extend the timeframe of the DREF operation by six weeks and to enable the completion of an operational review exercise.|MDRSL006

9247|"""Information and Public Relations” was Overspent by 4,723 and was due to the fact that the activities were budgeted under ‘communication’ and also there was need for additional publicity activities aimed to sensitize the public, national and international media and donors on the situation, needs on the ground and the humanitarian response."|MDRSL006
9248|A balance of CHF 148,813 will be returned to the DREF.|MDRSL006
9287|In July 2016, rain caused a series of flooding that continued into September 2016 and caused flooding in six of the 14 regions in Senegal.|MDRSN012
9288|The flooding impacted more than 20,000 people causing a large number of homeless people in the region of Saint-Louis, more precisely in the department of Dagana.|MDRSN012
9289|The most affected areas were Dagana, Safrene, Touba and Fatick.|MDRSN012
9290|While the government with its technical and financial partners mobilized funds to respond to the food crisis, new floods intensified the distress of vulnerable populations.|MDRSN012
9291|Consequently, during the nights of 4 and 5 September 2016, heavy rain accompanied by strong winds caused significant damage.|MDRSN012
9292|In Saint-Louis, some 1,313 families were affected; including seven deaths and 270 injured.|MDRSN012
9293|The storm destroyed and damaged houses, destroyed crops, schools, sleeping materials, household goods and personal belongings.|MDRSN012
9294|In addition, food reserves, poultry and livestock were lost in 4 towns and in the 40 affected villages.|MDRSN012
9295|The IFRC through its Country Cluster based in Dakar provided technical support to the Senegalese Red Cross Society (SRCS) to launch a DREF.|MDRSN012
9296|The emergency operation was intended to provide assistance to the beneficiaries across a range of sectors (including Health and Care, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion and Shelter), over a period of three months.|MDRSN012
9297|The following achievements are part of the package of activities undertaken by the National Society to provide relief to the affected population:|MDRSN012
9298|The needs assessment was undertaken|MDRSN012
9299|A total of 1,000 mosquito nets, 500 kitchen kits, 500 buckets, 1,000 mats, 330 jerry cans, 1,000 tarpaulins, 500 shelter kits, 500 kitchen kits 1,000 blankets, 1,000 mosquito nets, 7,000 aqua tabs, 1,000 bottles of bleach, 1,000 soap bars, 1,000 bottles of bleaching, 7,000 aqua tabs were distributed.|MDRSN012
9300|The distribution of aqua tabs was accompanied with sensitization sessions on their use|MDRSN012
9301|A total of 76 volunteers were trained on the registration of beneficiaries, distribution of relief items, promotion of hygiene, and use of shelter kits|MDRSN012
9302|However, following an additional assessment as well as some delay in the implementation of relief activities, the National Society proposed to refocus the scope of the response required.|MDRSN012
9303|Hence the request of one-month timeframe extension to enable the assistance of additional affected communities (50 additional households).|MDRSN012
9304|However, the extension was not granted.|MDRSN012
9305|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID) the Medtronic, Zurich and Coca Cola Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRSN012

9319|The Gambia is a country of more than 300 km inside Senegalese territory.|MDRSN013
9320|During the presidential elections in December 2016, The Gambia was a concern because of the outgoing President's challenge to the results.|MDRSN013
9321|Despite the efforts of the international community for a peaceful resolution, the situation remained tense causing massive displacement of populations towards Senegal.|MDRSN013
9322|According to UNHCR, more than 45,000 people reportedly crossed the Senegalese borders.|MDRSN013
9323|These displaced persons were comprised of Gambians, Senegalese, Sierra Leoneans, Mauritanians, Guineans, Malians and Ivoirians1.|MDRSN013
9324|Information collected by the various local committees of the Senegalese Red Cross Society (SRCS) in areas bordering The Gambia reported more than 27,563 displaced persons, including 1,851 children under five years old, 347 pregnant women, and 602 elderly persons.|MDRSN013
9325|This massive population movement caused a critical humanitarian situation.|MDRSN013
9326|Even though the first arrivals were absorbed by host populations, during the last few days, massive inflow of displaced persons that exceeded local communities’ capacities was noted.|MDRSN013
9327|The increasing number of arrivals has t high pressure on host communities that were no longer able to face the urgent needs of accommodation, food, water and latrines.|MDRSN013
9328|There were very few partners in the area responding to the increasing needs of displaced persons and host communities.|MDRSN013
9329|The security situation evolved with the departure into exile of the out-going President on 21 January, 2017.|MDRSN013
9330|Thousands of people returned home from Senegal as the country’s new President pledged stability.|MDRSN013
9331|Many people needed assistance to go back home.|MDRSN013
9332|Hence buses sent by the Senegalese and Gambian authorities to help repatriate displaced people.|MDRSN013
9333|The International Federation of Red Cross released a DREF to ensure that the displaced people, received appropriate assistance.|MDRSN013
9334|Through the DREF operation, the target host families got support and the capacities of the Senegalese Red Cross branches were reinforced through a lessons learned workshop focusing on the best practices.|MDRSN013
9335|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID) the Medtronic, Zurich and Coca Cola Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRSN013

9349|In June 2017, a total of 336 migrants were voluntarily repatriated to Senegal.|MDRSN014
9350|The International Organization for Migration (IOM) organized their return, in collaboration with the Senegalese authorities and the Directorate for Senegalese Abroad (DGSE) of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.|MDRSN014
9351|Most migrants had been held in overcrowded detention centres without adequate access to clean water, food, toilets and basic health services.|MDRSN014
9352|In their attempt to reach Europe via Libya, most of them were subjected to arbitrary detention, violence and other forms of abuse, such as forced labour and extortion of funds from the smugglers and traffickers.|MDRSN014
9353|The recorded arrivals in June were as follows:|MDRSN014
9354|171 migrants returned to Dakar by air while over 40 others arrived by road from Libya, including several returns of migrants by land from Niger (transport organized by IOM) on 1 June 2017.|MDRSN014
9355|165 Senegalese migrants from 14 regions (including one woman) were repatriated by air to Senegal on 6 June 2017, most of them from detention centres in Libya.|MDRSN014
9356|As shared by IOM, the total voluntary Senegalese returnees assisted during the period from January to August 2017, whether from Niger or from Libya or globally elsewhere by IOM is as follows:|MDRSN014
9357|Stripped of their possessions, abused and disappointed, most migrants have been traumatized by what they experienced and needed support to get back on their feet and restart their lives.|MDRSN014
9358|With support from IFRC and in coordination with the local authorities and IOM, the SRCS supported the returnees at the arrival phase, through the provision of Psychosocial Support (PSS) and reintegration programmes to help them for a dignified return.|MDRSN014
9359|It is worth mentioning that Senegal has traditionally been a major destination country in West Africa and has now become a country of emigration, migration and transit.|MDRSN014
9360|In recent years, Senegal has become the second country provider of West African migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean, following The Gambia; they leave in the hope of a better life.|MDRSN014
9391|Senegal, like many Sahelian countries, has suffered the negative effects of this major crisis because of its biophysical and economic situation further weakened by climate change.|MDRSN015
9392|The issue of access to sufficient quantity and quality food, especially for the most vulnerable population, has become more complex due to the recurring food and nutrition crisis.|MDRSN015
9393|Linking food security and resilience has thus become central to the overall problem of “poverty reduction and development”.|MDRSN015
9394|According to the Harmonized Framework focusing on the analysis and identification of risk areas and food and nutrition insecure population in the Sahel and West Africa (CH), as well as the regional analysis of the food and nutritional insecurity situation during March-May 2017 period and the projected one regarding June-August 2017, the food consumption has been generally satisfactory except in the Lake Chad Basin, in some areas in Niger, Mali and Senegal.|MDRSN015
9395|However, despite the announcement of a good cereal production, many departments have experienced a tense food situation with very poor access strategies to food.|MDRSN015
9396|The March 2017 Harmonized Framework map showed an under pressure phase 2 situation and a projected one for the period June-August 2017 with areas in crisis phase 3 in Senegal.|MDRSN015
9397|According to forecasts, this slightly tense current situation was supposed to worsen during the projected period July-August September 2017 with seven (7) departments in crisis phase 3 and thirty-two (32) under pressure including two (2) in minimum phase.|MDRSN015
9398|Two departments among the seven (7) concerned, namely Goudiry and Bambey were the main areas where a DREF intervention was requested.|MDRSN015
9399|The deterioration of food security situation was projected to be partly due to the deterioration of food access with rising prices combined to the depletion of stocks.|MDRSN015
9400|Besides, there has been a worrying nutritional situation with regard to the historical series of nutritional data (2010 to 2015).|MDRSN015
9401|According to forecasts, a total of 830,000 people, 7% of the population, were at risk to be in crisis during the lean season.|MDRSN015
9402|The deterioration of food access was projected to be accentuated by the decline or elimination of some income sources.|MDRSN015
9403|In view of the above situation, on 11 August 2017, the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) of the IFRC launched a DREF Operation for CHF 207,880 to support Senegal RC in providing food and preventive nutrition activities for 1,522 households in Goudiry and Bambey, to enable the affected population to survive and meet its immediate needs.|MDRSN015
9404|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), AECID, the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRSN015

9415|On 26 March 2015 the Saudi-led coalition started an air bombardment campaign targeting the positions of the Houthi rebels and forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh in Yemen.|MDRSO003
9416|The following months saw an escalation in air bombardment in the capital Sana`a, Hadramouth, Sa`ada, Taiz, and many other areas in Yemen, which affected an estimated 500,000 people, including 244,000 Somali registered refugees according to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).|MDRSO003
9417|As a result, Somali and Yemeni nationals and other third country nationals affected by the crisis begun to flee the country through the ports of Al Mukalla and Mukha in Yemen.|MDRSO003
9418|The Somali Red Crescent Society (SRCS) supported by IFRC and the ICRC mobilized its staff and volunteers in Berbera and Bosaso branches to respond to the crisis.|MDRSO003
9419|The services provided by the SRCS included first aid, primary health care through the mobile health clinics, hygiene and sanitation at the reception centres, vaccination of the new arrivals (adults and children), Restoration of Family Links (RFL), distribution of food and non-food items, referral of cases to the hospitals, assistance of people with special needs in evacuation from the vessels and handling their luggage through the port.|MDRSO003
9420|The SRCS branches in Bosaso and Berbera in collaboration with the respective Ministries of Health (MoH), World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) administered polio and measles vaccinations on the new arrivals and screened the children to determine their nutrition status.|MDRSO003
9421|In addition, SRCS volunteers distributed water and wet meals and refreshments provided by the Danish Refugee Council, Norwegian Refugee Council, Tadamun Social Society and other local NGOs.|MDRSO003
9422|While at Bosaso reception centre, the SRCS branch supported by IFRC provided wet meals for 60 people on arrival.|MDRSO003
9423|There was one reception centre in Bosaso town and another one had planned to be opened by the Puntland Ministry of Interior and the Inter-Agency Task Force led by UNHCR and IOM in an existing building to accommodate the increasing number of the arrivals, however, the centre was never opened.|MDRSO003
9424|In Berbera there were two reception centres, however due to the low number of the new arrivals, the second reception centre was not fully operational by the end of the DREF operation.|MDRSO003
9425|The reception centres were managed by the Inter-Agency Task Force led by UNHCR and International Organization of Migration (IOM) in coordination with the local authorities, while the SRCS provided hygiene and sanitation services to keep the reception centres clean.|MDRSO003
9426|The returnees and refugees were registered at the reception centres under the supervision of UNHCR.|MDRSO003
9427|On 23 April 2015, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) released CHF 43,330 from the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to support the Somali Red Crescent Society (SRCS) to respond to the needs of the 2,000 refugees/returnees arriving in Bosaso and Berbera ports, for a period of two months.|MDRSO003
9428|According to the Inter-Agency Task Force which included the UN agencies, International NGOs, SRCS and the government of Somaliland and Puntland, it was anticipated that an estimated 43,000 new returnees/refugees will arrive through Berbera, Bosaso and Mogadishu ports between May and September 2015.|MDRSO003
9429|The Inter-Agency Task Force expressed concerns about the increasing needs of the new arrivals and the need to do more to assist in the delivery of the services to the refugees/returnees.|MDRSO003
9430|On 2 July 2015, an Operations Update was issued, which extended the timeframe of the DREF operation by two months (New end date: 23 August 2015) and released an additional allocation of CHF 29,719 to enable SRCS continue responding to the on-going influx of refugees/returnees in Berbera (Somaliland) and Bosaso (Puntland) increasing the number of target population from 2,000 to 5,000 people.|MDRSO003
9431|The DREF was replenished by DG ECHO, the German Red Cross, Netherlands Red Cross/Silent Emergencies Fund and Tsunami Residual Funding.|MDRSO003

9446|On Monday 2 November 2015, Tropical Cyclone Chapala made a landfall in Yemen; however its effects were also felt across the Gulf of Aden in Somalia where extensive rainfall was experienced in the Northern Bari region in Bosaso district, Puntland.|MDRSO004
9447|Affected areas included Baargaal, Bander, Bareeda, Butiyaal, Caluula, Murcanyo, Qandalla, Xaabo and some parts of Xaafun.|MDRSO004
9448|On 4 November 2015, there was more rainfall from Tropical Cyclone Chapala in Berbera district, Somaliland, specifically in Biyacad, Bulahar, Ceelsheik, and Shacable situated on the west coast of Sahil region, causing additional population displacement.|MDRSO004
9449|Following Tropical Cyclone Chapala, a new Tropical Cyclone named ‘Megh’ arrived from the Arabian Sea causing even more rains in parts of Bari region in Puntland.|MDRSO004
9450|Areas affected included, Af Kalahay, Alula, Bareda, BiyoCade, Boolimoog, Dhurbo, Fagoora, Geesalay, Murcanyo, Sayn Weyn, Sayn Yar, Toxin and Xaabo.|MDRSO004
9451|According to a joint inter-agency rapid assessment more than 500 families (4,000 people) were affected by Tropical Cyclones Chapala and Megh, the majority of whom lived in Gardaful Region, Puntland, which was reported to have been the worst affected.|MDRSO004
9452|No human loss of life was reported, but the rainfall and waves washed away people’s homes, fishing boats and nets, killed livestock (an estimated 3,000 sheep and goats, as well as 200 camels were killed) and caused damage/destruction to public infrastructure including hospitals, roads and schools.|MDRSO004
9453|On 13 November 2015, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) released 27,823 Swiss franc from the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to support the Somalia Red Crescent Society (SRCS) respond to the needs of the 150 families (900 people), for a period of 1 month.|MDRSO004
9454|An Operations Update was issued on 18 December 2015 to extend the timeframe of the DREF operation by 6 weeks to enable the replenishment of non-food items (NFIs), which had been procured and had been delivered late due to issues experienced with transportation to the area of implementation (changes in tide patterns impacting on travel by boat).|MDRSO004
9455|The DREF operation ended on 31 January 2016.|MDRSO004
9456|This DREF was replenished by DG ECHO and the Netherlands Red Cross/Silent Emergencies Fund.|MDRSO004

9458|The IFRC, on behalf of the Somalia Red Crescent Society would like to extend many thanks to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRSO004
9477|Somalia is prone to a cycle of natural disasters such as drought, flooding and tropical cyclones because of climate-change phenomena of La-Nina and El-Nino.|MDRSO006
9478|Early indications of the country experiencing food insecurity emerged in September 2015 and in February 2016.|MDRSO006
9479|The Somaliland and Puntland authorities subsequently issued separate alerts with Appeals to humanitarian agencies and donors for support to the drought response.|MDRSO006
9480|The drought conditions continued through 2016 and worsened from November, affecting more that 50 percent of the population.|MDRSO006
9481|Country-wide, the cumulative total displacements, directly attributable or related to drought between 01 November 2016 and 31 March 2017, was 535,624 (UNHCR, April 2017).|MDRSO006
9482|Loss of livelihoods, mainly livestock, shortage of water, pasture and food due to the drought have been responsible for these displacements.|MDRSO006
9483|Drought naturally contribute to trigger increases in epidemics such as Acute Watery Diarrhoea (AWD)/Cholera and measles, some of which are cross-border outbreaks.|MDRSO006
9484|A total of 77,133 case of AWD and 1,159 deaths were reported in different parts of Somalia from January to September 2017.|MDRSO006
9485|Of these cases, 58.8 per cent have occurred in children below five years of age.|MDRSO006
9486|There has been a gradual reduction in the number of new AWD/Cholera cases in all regions of Somalia since August 2017.|MDRSO006
9487|No cholera related deaths have been reported across this same period in any region across Somalia.|MDRSO006
9488|The number of AWD/Cholera cases has declined from a peak, at the beginning of June (week 22), of 5,306 cases to the latest reported and lowest number of 93 cases in the third week (week 33) of August.|MDRSO006
9489|Similarly, the AWD Case Fatality Rate (CFR) has decreased from its peak of 4.7 percent in February 2017 to zero per cent in August.|MDRSO006
9490|As at 2 April 2017, Puntland had a cumulative reported case of AWD/cholera since the beginning of the year at 1,674 and 57 deaths, indicating a case fatality rate (CFR) of 3.4 percent.|MDRSO006
9491|In Somaliland, the AWD outbreak reported as at 10 April in the Buuhole community on the Somaliland/Ethiopian border was 291 cases and 14 deaths, indicating a CFR of 4.8 percent.|MDRSO006
9492|Since the beginning of the year, communities with most reported AWD cases in Puntland were Goldogob, Jariban and Galkayo (IDP camps) in the Mudug Region, Bosaso (mainly in the Tawakal IDP Camp) in the Bari region and Garowe (Washington IDP camp), Eyl and Burtinle in the Nugal Region.|MDRSO006
9493|In Somaliland, the reported cases were in the Buuhole district as well as pockets of Teleh in the Sool region areas in the Toogdheer and Awdal regions respectively.|MDRSO006
9494|This brought the total number of affected regions in Somaliland and Puntland to six.|MDRSO006
9495|The IFRC has supported the National Society to respond independently to the reported outbreaks so far, this year, including chlorination, case management and social mobilization or to collaborate with partners such as UNICEF, WHO and the Ministry of Health as well as other actors such as WVI, SCI, HPA and IOM in the responses in Puntland and Somaliland.|MDRSO006
9496|The AWD outbreaks appeared not to be abating and hence the need to scale up the National Society’s preparedness, response and social mobilization capacities.|MDRSO006
9497|Priority areas of focus in this regard were the provision of AWD/cholera supplies, training of staff and volunteers in case management, active surveillance with tools to undertake that, provision of sanitation equipment to target communities and enhanced community mobilization interventions with support of the DREF.|MDRSO006
9543|On 3 November 2015, 4 ½ months after a cholera outbreak was declared on 23 June 2015, the Government of South Sudan, through its Ministry of Health, declared an end to the outbreak2.|MDRSS004
9544|At final tally, the emergency recorded 1,818 laboratory-confirmed cases and claimed 47 lives in Central Equatoria State and Jonglei State3.|MDRSS004
9545|Juba County in Central Equatoria was, by far, the mostaffected, accounting for 89 per cent (1,622) of cases in 7 payams.|MDRSS004
9546|26 June SSRC begins mobilization of volunteers and NFI, 3 days after the cholera outbreak was declared.|MDRSS004
9547|The National Society submits a request for a DREF application.|MDRSS004
9548|Generally, the outbreak was characterized by predictable epidemiological patterns, peak in late July when case fatality rate reached 6.6%, before slowing down after a secondary peak in August 2015.|MDRSS004
9549|The outbreak was triggered by heavy rain which normally started mid-year, the worst was over within the first 2 months, with 100 new cases recorded since 5 September, largely due to concerted intervention efforts from the government and international agencies.|MDRSS004
9550|The emergency response took place as an ongoing internal conflict entered its 20th month in August 2015, although the outbreak was largely confined to Juba, away from the fighting that continued to rage further North in the states of Jonglei, Unity and Upper Nile.|MDRSS004
9551|3 July|MDRSS004
9552|SSRC Juba branch conducts social mobilization refresher workshops for 50 volunteers.|MDRSS004

9554|Volunteers visit 192 households on their first day.|MDRSS004
9555|Epidemiological data throughout the outbreak shows children < 5yrs to be the most vulnerable: cumulative weeks saw the rate of transmission among this age group grew steadily from 14 % to 24 %.|MDRSS004
9556|At the peak of the outbreak, case fatality Rate (CFR) for this group (< 5yrs ) was almost double that of the general population.|MDRSS004

9582|South Sudan, the world’s newest Country, has declared a cholera outbreak for the third year in a row since 2014 – 2017.|MDRSS005
9583|During these reporting period, cases continued rising in Bentiu at the Protection of Civilian sites (POC), Leer and Juba (POC) and new cases re-appeared in Minkaman (Awerial).|MDRSS005
9584|As of 20 January 2017, cumulatively, 4,401 cholera cases including 81 deaths (43 facilities and 38 community) (CFR 1.84%) have been reported in South Sudan involving 9 states since the initial case was reported on the 18 June 2016, for Jubek state, 3 July 2016, in Jonglei state; 14 July 2016, for Terekeka state.|MDRSS005
9585|These were followed by an official declaration of the Cholera outbreak on the 23 July 2016.|MDRSS005
9586|Subsequently, other states also declared outbreaks thereafter.|MDRSS005
9587|Declarations were made on the 15 August 2016 Eastern Lakes and Imatong states; 10 August 2016 for Fangak in Western Bieh and state; 29 September 2016, for Rubkona in Northern Liech state; 11 October 2016, for Leer and 22 October 2016, for Panyijiar in Southern Liech state; and 10 October 2016, for Pigi in Eastern Nile state|MDRSS005
9588|In July 2016, the conflict and rainy season contributed to difficult situation of accessing safe water and sanitation.|MDRSS005
9589|These were of concern in overcrowded areas such as Internal Displaced Persons (IDP) settlements, Protection of Civilian sites (PoCs) and urban residential areas.|MDRSS005
9590|The July crisis displaced many vulnerable people into settlements and Protection of Civilians sites which is overcrowded making access to clean water difficult.|MDRSS005
9591|Furthermore, access to hospital, sanitation facilities became very difficult, further exacerbating the existing conditions and worsening the access to cholera and other health related treatment.|MDRSS005
9592|The Cholera outbreak in 2016, took longer than the previous years, with higher number of cases 4,401 compared to 1,718 cases last year, 81 deaths compared to 46 deaths during last year Cholera outbreak.|MDRSS005
9593|Partners put efforts together to control the outbreak, the number reached by social mobilization exceeded SSRC target, nonetheless there was an increment in the cholera cases.|MDRSS005
9691|Tropical storms in the Southern Hemisphere affected the Pacific coasts of countries such as Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico, among others.|MDRSV008
9692|An unusual phenomenon, which occurred 2 to 4 May 2015, brought with it waves exceeding two metres above sea level, leaving dozens of victims, evacuees and damage to infrastructure in the Central American Pacific in its wake.|MDRSV008
9693|Judging from reports from relief organizations and isthmus media, the Salvadorean coasts were among the hardest hit.|MDRSV008
9694|Damage could be seen across the entire coastline in the departments of Ahuachapán, Sonsonate, La Libertad, La Paz, San Vicente, Usulután and La Union.|MDRSV008
9695|Of the population affected in the departments of Ahuachapán, Sonsonate, La Libertad, La Paz and Usulután, 1 person went missing, 1,367 were evacuated, 514 were in collective centres and 1,270 were self-sheltered; others migrated to areas where they had access to family shelters and to the Chapina Garita area near the border with Guatemala.|MDRSV008
9696|In Guatemala, some 20 families from the Botoncillo and Bola de Monte areas were sheltered in Ahuachapán.|MDRSV008
9697|Civil Protection authorities issued an Orange Alert on 13 May as a second round of high waves hit Salvadorean coasts, which damaged housing and impacted the affected people’s water and sanitation agricultural livelihoods, as well as other basic services.|MDRSV008
9752|The drought El Salvador has been experiencing since 2013 has mostly affected its eastern region; however, the situation became worse after May 2014, causing the loss of a high percentage of maize and bean crops, a high rate of food insecurity, and difficulty accessing financial resources which would have come from crop sales, which is an important source of income for farming families.|MDRSV009
9753|More than 100,000 farmers across the country have suffered losses.|MDRSV009
9754|According to El Salvador's Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG) and its counterpart ministries in Central America1, the 2016 El Niño phenomenon will have an even more negative impact on agricultural activities, which makes it necessary to remain alert and to provide for resources and efforts including international cooperation to deal with the difficult situation which especially affects poor families and farmers in eastern El Salvador.|MDRSV009
9755|Eastern regions have very limited access to drinking water systems, so many communities get their water from artisan wells, rainwater harvesting, or by purchasing bottled water, which impacts the financial situation of those who have lost their crops.|MDRSV009
9756|According to official data, crop yields are down by 75 per cent due to low rainfall levels.|MDRSV009
9757|As this drought has affected much of the Central American region, the Central American Agricultural Council (CAC) in San Salvador declared a regional emergency on 21 August 2015.|MDRSV009
9758|According to Fewsnet, this current El Niño will cause below-normal levels of accumulated rainfall in Nicaraguan and Honduran Atlantic basins during the first quarter of 2016, which could have a negative impact on the second red bean planting season.|MDRSV009
9759|It is expected that the majority of poor Dry Corridor subsistence farmer and day labourer households in south-western Honduras, eastern El Salvador, and north-western Nicaragua will be considered as under Stress (Phase 2, CIF) from December to February, with a seasonal improvement in terms of access to food thanks to second season harvests, job opportunities in the coffee sector, stabilization of grain prices, and food assistance programmes underway.|MDRSV009
9760|Because of the up to 100 per cent corn crop losses (first planting season) among subsistence farmers in the Dry Corridor; the deterioration of livelihoods given consecutive losses over the past years; and the effects of the drier and warmerthan-usual conditions predicted for the first quarter of 2016, the poorest households in these areas will have once again returned to a crisis status (Phase 3, CIF) as of March 2016 if no assistance is provided.|MDRSV009
9761|It is important to note that the most affected departments in eastern El Salvador are Usulután, San Miguel, Morazán, and La Unión.|MDRSV009
9762|Projections for 2016 remain unchanged; however, a slight improvement is expected as of August 2016, which is why the SRCS launched an international emergency appeal to respond to the needs of the population so as to contribute to their speedy recovery and resilience in future emergencies.|MDRSV009
9770|On 5 May 2018, the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, MARN (for its acronym in Spanish) reported the occurrence of a seismic swarm between the municipalities of Chirilagua (department of San Miguel), Intipucá and El Carmen (department of La Union).|MDRSV011
9771|The National Seismic Network of El Salvador registered a total of 733 earthquakes between 6:33 p.m. on Saturday 5 May 2018 and 6:00 a.m. on Wednesday 9 May 2018.|MDRSV011
9772|The epicentre is located between the municipalities of Chirilagua (department of San Miguel) and Intipucá (department of La Unión); of all the earthquakes registered up to that date, 95 per cent of them were felt by the population, with magnitudes oscillating between 2.4 and 5.6 on the Richter Scale.|MDRSV011
9773|The largest magnitude earthquake of 5.6 and an intensity of VII on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale was recorded at 1:02 p.m. on Sunday, 6 May in the municipalities of Chirilagua and Intipucá; this earthquake caused severe damage to the municipalities’ houses since must of the structures are made of mud, adobe or bahareque (mud with grass).|MDRSV011
9774|The National Civil Protection System’s damages report indicated that the earthquake damaged 289 houses, destroyed 11 houses damaged 9 educational centres, caused slight damage to structures in the municipalities of Conchagua and Intipucá and affected 2 roads (road blockages in the detour La Estrechura and El Capulín and two rock slides in the El Litoral highway [CA-2 E]).|MDRSV011
9775|On the day of the issuance of the seismic swarm alert, the SRCS’s headquarters’ monitoring system was activated, and in coordination with the Usuluán of San Miguel, La Union and Intipucá branches, the SRCS’s emergency operations centre continuously monitored the situation for ten days.|MDRSV011
9776|On Monday, 14 May, personnel from the SRCS’s headquarters in monitored the departmental civil protection committee’s actions and the delivery of aid to the municipality of Intipucá.|MDRSV011
9777|Additionally, the SRCS’s branches in the seismic zone supported the local authorities’ evacuation of affected people to safe places.|MDRSV011
9850|Fighting between the Nigerian Armed Forces and Boko Haram militia group in northern Nigeria continued to result in the displacement of thousands of people across the border into neighbouring Chad.|MDRTD014
9851|From 1 January 2015, intense fighting in the town of Baga prompted an estimated 7,300 people in the surrounding areas to relocate to the Lake Chad region.|MDRTD014
9852|The Nigerian refugees were accommodated in camps in Baga Sola and N’gouboua, which were provided by the local authorities, or in host communities.|MDRTD014
9853|Host communities were highly affected by this influx, because they had to share their scarce resources and limited infrastructure with refugees.|MDRTD014
9854|The Chadian government decided to intervene and support Cameroonian and Nigerian Armed Forces in their fight against Boko Haram, which was expected to lead to more refugees and Chadian nationals crossing the border into Chad and neighbouring countries.|MDRTD014
9855|On 23 January 2015, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) allocated 140,868 CHF from the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to support the Red Cross of Chad (RCC) meet the immediate needs of 2,500 people (500 households) in N’gouboua, in the areas of emergency shelter and non-food items (NFIs), health, water, sanitation and hygiene, for a period of two months.|MDRTD014
9856|On 13 February 2015, an incursion by suspected Boko Haram militants into N’gouboua resulted in the death of seven civilians, burning of homes and belongings, as well as population movement in the area.|MDRTD014
9857|According to local authorities, the populations of the N’gouboua camp, and surrounding villages (Kaiga, Koulfoua and Tetewa) fled to Baga Sola to seek security.|MDRTD014
9858|An office was set up in the town hall in Baga Sola to identify and register returnees and internally displaced populations.|MDRTD014
9859|As of 28 February 2015, 154 Chadian returnees from Nigeria (34 households), and 2,708 Chadians (819 households) who came temporarily from N’gouboua and other surrounding villages were registered, of which most are living with host families.|MDRTD014
9860|Other movements were noticed, mainly from in N’gouboua to Forkolom, while children and teenagers were coming from N’gouboua and Tchoukoutalia to join their families.|MDRTD014
9861|As a result of the evolving security situation combined with the non-availability of staff to be deployed to support the DREF operation, logistical constraints, and issues surrounding the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) implementation of planned activities was delayed.|MDRTD014
9862|On 27 March 2015, an Operations Update was issued to extend the timeframe by two months and re-orientate the activities planned in N’gouboua to the new locations in Baga Sola where the people had settled following the incursion of the suspected Boko Haram militants.|MDRTD014
9863|This DREF has been partially replenished by the Netherlands Red Cross/Silent Emergencies Fund.|MDRTD014
9864|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), the Medtronic, Zurich and other corporate and private donors.|MDRTD014
9865|The IFRC, on behalf of the Red Cross of Chad would like to extend many thanks to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRTD014
9919|In early 2017, Chad was found to have pockets of severe food insecurity with population facing serious nutritional issues.|MDRTD015
9920|According to the Cadre Harmonisé, of March 2017, about 13,102 people were then in Emergency (phase 4) while an estimated 367,218 people in four districts were in Crisis (phase 3).|MDRTD015
9921|These vulnerable people needed food, affordable basic commodities, rehabilitation and nutrition, health and other livelihood assistance and capacity-building for resilience.|MDRTD015
9922|An estimated 1,886,800 people in 18 districts were in Stress (phase 2).|MDRTD015
9923|These people needed support to build resilience, develop their livelihoods and keep severe malnutrition at acceptably low levels.|MDRTD015
9924|Projected figures were showing a worsening situation with more than 897,408 people in Crisis or Emergency situation (Phase3 to 5) from June to August 2017.|MDRTD015
9925|Humanitarian efforts of the government and its partners were not able to curb the progression of the difficulty of accessing food.|MDRTD015
9926|Besides, the low coverage of humanitarian assistance in country, the depletion of the food stock, the limited coping strategies and the increasing number of food insecure people darkened the food security and malnutrition picture in Chad.|MDRTD015
9927|In view of this, food aid, accompanied by strong actions for better nutritional and livelihood protection, was required.|MDRTD015
9928|Considering that the food and nutritional situation is periodic (lean season), the Red Cross of Chad (CRC) with the support from the IFRC Sahel Country Cluster Support Team (Sahel Cluster) and the IFRC Niger Country Office, made a commitment to work upstream (preparation) and downstream (post-response) to better understand the food insecurity problem and provide adequate short and long-term interventions.|MDRTD015
9929|As such, on 11 August 2017, the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) of the IFRC launched a DREF operation for CHF 233,017 to support the Red Cross of Chad to respond to the emergency in the vulnerable groups identified and to to conduct a detailed assessments which would feed in the preparation of a strong four-year program, based on a preparedness and resilience approach.|MDRTD015
9930|This operation equally aimed at providing food and preventive nutrition activities for 1,900 households and enable the affected population to survive and meet its immediate needs during the lean season (July to October 2017).|MDRTD015
9931|Overall, the operation targeted 12,350 people.|MDRTD015
9932|In November 2017, a DREF Operation Update was approved, extending the operation timeframe for a further two months until 11 January 2018.|MDRTD015
9933|This was to allow proper completion of planned activities which had been delayed for security reasons and to enable the National Society to take part in the regional lessons-learned workshop set for December 2017 in Dakar.|MDRTD015
9934|To note, the lessons-learned workshop was to encompass all the five Food security DREF operations launched in August 2017.|MDRTD015
9935|The major donors and partners of this DREF included the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), AECID, the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRTD015
9936|On behalf of the Red Cross of Chad (CRC), the IFRC would like to extend its gratitude to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRTD015
9949|Following the declaration of the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) of a cholera epidemic in the village of Maréna, Koukou Angarana sub-prefecture, the Chad Red Cross (CRC) Sila regional committee carried out a needs assessment mission from 21 to 22 August 2017 in Maréna, Tyéro and Dogdoré villages, where the epidemic started on 14 August 2017.|MDRTD016
9950|The epidemic spread on September 11, 2017 to the Salamat region, more specifically in the village of Amdjoudoul, Mouraye sub-prefecture.|MDRTD016
9951|Indeed, a total of 277 cases of cholera was confirmed with 11 deaths, a case fatality rate of 4% in Salamat.|MDRTD016
9952|The number of cases increased during the last 3 weeks with the proven presence of an epicentre with at week 40 (S40) a total of 71 against 172 at week 41 (S41).|MDRTD016
9953|Upon request of the National Society, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) launched a DREF operation for CHF 227,145 to support its response to the cholera outbreak.|MDRTD016
9954|The operation targeted 3,000 households or 18,000 people to whom water, sanitation, hygiene and health awareness were provided in Salamat region.|MDRTD016
9955|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), AECID, the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRTD016

9974|Clashes between armed groups in the North of Paoua in the Central African Republic (CAR) and a steady upsurge of violence starting late December 2017 led thousands of people to flee, crossing the border areas of the Eastern Logone region into the southern part of Chad.|MDRTD017
9975|According to UNHCR Southern Emergency Response Plan (Central African Refugees), released on 12 March 2018, about 19,910 Central African refugees had arrived in Chad by early 2018.|MDRTD017
9976|During the last week of February 2018, approximately 2,500 new arrivals were recorded in Moissala, in the south of the country.|MDRTD017
9977|This latest influx was the largest population movement observed since the beginning of the CAR crisis in 2013.|MDRTD017
9978|It exceeded the total number of arrivals to Chad for the whole of 2017, which amounted to 2,000 people.|MDRTD017
9979|Given the volatile and unpredictable security situation in the North of CAR (Ouham Pende), the presence of refugees was predicted to likely to continue for a long time.|MDRTD017
9980|As such, the RCRC Movement (Chad Red Cross, ICRC and French Red Cross) conducted a joint needs assessment to analyse the situation and provide the most appropriate response.|MDRTD017
9981|The assessment as well as the UNHCR Emergency Response Plan, highlighted that over 40 host villages were overwhelmed by a precarious food situation, with urgent need for shelter, food, drinking water, health, education and care for children.|MDRTD017
9982|There was also a need to strengthen basic services (water, sanitation and health) in those villages.|MDRTD017
9983|On 30 March 2018, a DREF operation of CHF 271,180 was granted to support the Chad Red Cross Society (CRCS) in responding to the direct needs of the refugees and host households.|MDRTD017
9984|However, the situation evolved and in May 2018 new figures from UNHCR highlighted a further increase in the refugee population.|MDRTD017
9985|UNHCR estimated the refugee population to be approximately 28,964, up from 19,910 reported in the first quarter of 2018.|MDRTD017
9986|"After noting the limited effects of the ""refugee camps"" approach on the socioeconomic integration of refugees, the government and UNHCR, favoured the settlement of refugees in host villages, to be part of the communities."|MDRTD017
9987|Therefore, following requests from the Chadian authorities, UNHCR announced a change in the intervention strategy for the CAR refugees in Goré area of Chad.|MDRTD017
9988|All refugees along the borders were relocated to four sites (Bekan, Bessao, Moissala and Yambodo) for security reasons and for their better integration through the establishment of adequate infrastructure and services (schools, health centres, water points, etc.).|MDRTD017
9989|Following this announcement, the Chad Red Cross Society (CRCS) readapted its strategy through an Operations Update, which included a two-month timeframe extension of the operation to accommodate all changes (location and activities) and second allocation of CHF 53,978 to allow full implementation of activities in accordance with the new strategy.|MDRTD017
9990|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), AECID, the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRTD017

10020|Since December 2015, Ghana was affected by a new strain of meningitis outbreak Pneumococcal Meningitis caused by streptococcus pneumoniae, which is both contagious and fatal.|MDRTG006
10021|As of 10 February 2016, there were 85 fatalities reported and 465 people hospitalized in Ghana.|MDRTG006
10022|The meningitis outbreak spread from Ghana to Togo, starting in the Kara region, the district of Dankpen, before moving on to the Western border district of Bassar.|MDRTG006
10023|As of 15 February 2016, the district of Dankpen reported a total of 219 cases and 12 deaths (case fatality rate (CFR): 5.5%) and the district of Bassar reported a total 63 cases including 9 deaths (CFR: 14.3%).|MDRTG006
10024|Following investigations in the district of Dankpen, it was identified that the causal agent was Neisseria Meningitides W135.|MDRTG006
10025|This strain of meningitis is rare and has common signs and symptoms similar to that of Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis (CSM).|MDRTG006
10026|It should be noted that the epidemic was expanding to other areas, not only in the districts of Kara region but also to neighbouring areas – since 5 February 2016 2 cases were reported in the Central region.|MDRTG006
10027|There was also a cross-border risk of spreading of cases to other countries in West Africa, in Ghana, potentially Cote d’Ivoire and beyond, at the time of the operation.|MDRTG006
10028|The hot and humid climate of Togo is a key factor to the proliferation of vectors for diseases and partly responsible for the National epidemiological profile dominated by infectious and parasitic diseases.|MDRTG006
10029|The months of March April with their scorching heat mark the transition between the dry season and the rainy season.|MDRTG006
10030|This period corresponds to the time when Togo can experience the onset of meningitis outbreaks (December to June) and also with lean periods where the malnutrition rate is very high.|MDRTG006
10031|In order to respond to the outbreak, on 25 February 2016, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) released 178,079 Swiss francs from the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to support Togolese Red Cross Society (TRCS).|MDRTG006
10032|The DREF operation was implemented to support 1,747,200 people (291,200 households) in the Savannes, Kara and Central regions, with substantial health care and hygiene promotion activities; over a period of 3 months initially and was extended for 1 more month to end in June 2016.|MDRTG006
10033|Initially, the Ministry of Health and Social Protection, according to the epidemiological situation, planned to conduct 1 vaccination campaign in response to this epidemic.|MDRTG006
10034|The rapid spread of cases in 3 regions motivated the health department to conduct 2 more vaccination campaigns.|MDRTG006
10035|This led to the extension and intensification of the activities for 1 month (June) without additional cost.|MDRTG006
10036|The major donors and partners of the TRCS in this meningitis operation include the IFRC and Catholic Relief Services (CRS).|MDRTG006
10037|The Togolese Red Cross Society would like to extend many thanks to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRTG006
10038|The DREF operations donors include: The Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), the Medtronic, Zurich and Coca Cola Foundations, and other corporate and private donors.|MDRTG006

10170|The neighbouring unaffected villages helped the affected population by bringing some food.|MDRTJ021
10182|High temperatures and the rapid melting of snow and glaciers between 1 July to 22 July 2015 triggered mudflows and floods in the Gorno Badakhshan province and the Rasht valley of Tajikistan.|MDRTJ022
10183|The assessments showed that the abrupt increase of air temperature in many mountainous areas of Tajikistan intensified the glaciers` melting and caused floods and raised the water levels of the rivers.|MDRTJ022
10184|The disaster affected the basins of the rivers Pyanj, Gund, Vakhsh, Zaravshan, Kafernigan, Isfara and Isfana.|MDRTJ022
10185|In the most devastated villages of Barsem, Berdibekobod and Kolkhozobod of Shugnan district of the GornoBadakhshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO) 72 residential buildings were completely and 14 partially destroyed, furthermore 140 families were evacuated to safer places in Khorog city and neighbouring villages.|MDRTJ022

10645|Through MVD prevention interventions URCS reached 58,064 persons, a slightly higher number then initially planned for, due to the decision of partners to expand the prevention activities to additional at risk districts in Kween and Bukwo.|MDRUG039
10646|The prevention messages reduced community resistance, and contributed to limiting the spread of MVD and subsequently to the control of the outbreak within two months after its declaration.|MDRUG039
10647|With Marburg being a highly virulent and communicatble disease, the implementation of the DREF operation required a dedicated and devoted volunteer force.|MDRUG039
10648|When on 7th December 2017, the outbreak was declared to be contained, a cumulative total number of 3 cases had been confirmed (1 probable, and 2 confirmed), with the last confirmed death recorded in Kaproron Health Centre IV in in Kapchorwa district on 26th October 2017.|MDRUG039

10704|On the afternoon of Friday, 15 April 2016, a strong tornado touched down in the city of Dolores in the department of Soriano, affecting mainly the city's downtown area.|MDRUY002
10705|"Departmental authorities indicated that the phenomenon was ""very large"" and more powerful than the one that occurred in 2012."|MDRUY002
10706|"The tornado's ""funnel"" began forming a little after 16:00h over western suburban areas of the city, later moving across General Fructuoso Rivera Street and toward the downtown area."|MDRUY002
10707|A few seconds later, it veered south, causing major damage to the area between Rivera (to the west), Route 21, the Juan Manuel Blanes perimeter road and Paso de la Arena road (to the east).|MDRUY002
10708|The most affected neighbourhoods were Cadol, Barrio Paris, Centro and Altos de Dolores.|MDRUY002
10709|The atmospheric phenomenon wreaked havoc on local homes, streets and businesses.|MDRUY002
10710|Assessments carried out by the authorities reported 1,544 affected families (4,431 people), and inspections gave1,643 damaged properties the following designations: 251 Reds (destroyed, with severe or total damage, 521 Yellows (damaged), and 871 Greens (minor damage).|MDRUY002
10711|Some 155 businesses were affected, which on average had engaged in commercial activities for 16 years: 63 per cent were formal, while the rest were informal; 27.1 per cent conducted business out of business owners’ homes, while 72.9 per cent did not; 55.8 per cent lost merchandise and raw materials; 51 per cent lost work tools; 23 per cent lost office equipment; and 73.9 per cent were uninsured.|MDRUY002

10724|Starting in February 2018, a significant decrease in precipitation led to a reduction of surface and ground water in the centre and north of Uruguay.|MDRUY003
10725|Government figures indicated that more than 11,000 people were affected by this disaster.|MDRUY003
10726|On 28 February 2018, the Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries (MGAP for its acronym in Spanish) declared a 90day state of emergency for the departments of Artigas, Durazno, Paysandú, Rivera, Río Negro, Salto and Tacuarembó in; on March 2018, 7 more departments were included (Cerro Largo, Colonia, Flores, Florida, Rocha, Soriano and Treinta y Tres), resulting in14 of the country’s19 departments being placed under a state of emergency during the disaster.|MDRUY003
10727|The government’s declaration of emergency addressed the needs of small-scale cattle farmers and milk producers by permitting cattle to access areas near the routes where water accumulates and through loans to purchase animal feed from small and medium-scale producers.|MDRUY003
10728|The Departmental Intendancy of Tacuarembó distributed water to the families and schools affected by the water deficit during the emergency, and it made some distributions at the request of the families.|MDRUY003
10729|The Uruguayan National Emergency System requested support from the URC during the emergency.|MDRUY003
10730|The URC conducted needs assessments and monitoring visits for the selection of the target population to be reached; during this process, the target communities demonstrated that they had safe water management capacities|MDRUY003
10793|On Tuesday, 29 November 2016, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was impacted by heavy rains, which resulted in flooding and landslides in several communities.|MDRVC003
10794|Sandy Bay in the north-eastern area of Saint Vincent was the most severely affected community.|MDRVC003
10795|However, the villages of Magum, Orange Hill, Overland, London, Point, Owia and Fancy in the north-east and Spring Village, Coulls Hill, Troumaca, Rose Bank, Sharpes, Fitz Hughes and Chateaubelair in the north-west of Saint Vincent were also impacted.|MDRVC003
10796|Some people suffered losses to their subsistence crops, livestock and dwelling houses.|MDRVC003
10797|The island’s water and sanitation systems were severely damaged.|MDRVC003
10798|Due to these health and financial challenges and the initial trauma from the disaster, the SVGRCS prioritized psychosocial support.|MDRVC003
10799|The government reported that the island’s physical infrastructure (roads and bridges) was extensively damaged.|MDRVC003
10800|Mudflows and debris blocked many roadways and coupled with the infrastructural damage, made many communities inaccessible by road.|MDRVC003
10801|Flooding and landslides caused significant damage to the major pipelines that supplied the villages throughout the north-eastern quarter of Saint Vincent.|MDRVC003
10802|Consequently, water for the area was supplied by tenders provided by the Central Water and Sewage Authority (CWSA).|MDRVC003
10803|The Jennings System was not operational in the aftermath of the disaster; as a consequence, the water supply in the following areas was affected: Byera, Mannings Village, Colonaire, Park Hill, South Rivers, Mt. Grenan, Diamonds Village, New Grounds, Lowmans Windward, Hadley’s Village, North Union, South Union, Cedars, Biabou, Jeffrey, Spring, Peruvian Vale, Argyle, Mt. Pleasant, Rawacou, Stubbs, Calder, Carapan and Diamond; other areas affected by water issues were the areas supplied by the Perseverance water distribution system:|MDRVC003
10804|Mt. Young, Georgetown, Dickson, O’Briens Valley, Spring, Mt. Bentick, Langley Park, Chapmans Village, Rabacca, Orange Hill, Field 18,Tourama and Sandy Bay.|MDRVC003
10805|The water supply was also disrupted in the North Leeward area from Coulls Hill to Richmond.|MDRVC003
10806|The flooding destroyed 15 houses, severely damaged 20 houses and partially damaged more than 50 houses.|MDRVC003
10807|Apart from the physical damage, many houses were inundated with flood water, which damaged household items.|MDRVC003
10808|Three emergencies collective centres were opened in Sandy Bay, which housed 55 people and 66 people were located at the secondary collective centres (relatives and friends).|MDRVC003
10809|Throughout the country, there were 79 people in emergency collective centres and 100 in secondary collective shelters at the peak of the disaster.|MDRVC003
10810|The affected families cleaned their homes, but they lacked the necessary equipment to remove settled water and silt.|MDRVC003
10811|Additionally, the areas around the affected houses were muddy and further rains worsened the situation.|MDRVC003
10812|Shelter, water, sanitation and psychosocial support in particular were important priorities for the communities.|MDRVC003
10845|Since the end of 2015, unusual dry conditions and a shortage of rainfall seriously affected the central and southern parts of Viet Nam.|MDRVN013
10846|Prolonged heat led to drought in the southern central, the central highlands, and the Mekong Delta of Viet Nam.|MDRVN013
10847|In Mekong Delta area, the situation was worsened by saltwater intrusion resulting from reduced rainfall.|MDRVN013
10848|Normally, the rainy season in these provinces starts from April or May and continues until October or November.|MDRVN013
10849|However, in 2015 they received below-average precipitation during the rainy season which ended in August (two months earlier than normal).|MDRVN013
10850|Correspondingly, the dry season and saltwater intrusion started around two months earlier than in previous years and the salinity was four times higher than the seasonal averages.|MDRVN013
10851|In Ben Tre, saltwater intruded 80 kilometres into the mainlands, leaving 75 per cent of the province experiencing salinity that was beyond acceptable standard for the domestic water.|MDRVN013
10852|Due to saltwater intrusion, the province faced a severe water shortage since it mainly depends on the surface water as groundwater is unusable due to contamination by acid sulfate.|MDRVN013
10853|Consequently, local people faced with water shortage and significant damage to agricultural production and livelihoods, and dramatic decrease in income since Mekong Delta is the biggest rice producer.|MDRVN013
10854|According the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), 39 out of 63 provinces reported being affected by drought and saltwater intrusion, with 15 provinces declaring drought and saltwater intrusion emergencies at different levels.|MDRVN013
10855|The water shortage affected 226,094 hectares of productive land, leaving 1.75 million people losing their livelihoods.|MDRVN013
10856|VNRC, with the support of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and Swiss Red Cross, conducted needs assessments in Long An, Ben Tre and Ca Mau from 18 to 20 March 2016 to understand the situation and priority of needs in the affected areas.|MDRVN013
10857|Food and safe water were found to be the most pressing needs.|MDRVN013
10858|To plan for response, MARD organized a development partners’ meeting on the drought situation and actions to be taken in March 2016.|MDRVN013
10859|Following this meeting, a multi-cluster and joint rapid assessment was carried out by the government and humanitarian actors.|MDRVN013
10860|The joint assessment teams, including representatives from MARD, Ministry of Health (MoH), The People’s Aid Coordinating Committee (PACCOM), INGOs and UN agencies.|MDRVN013
10861|It was conducted from 21 to 24 March 2016.|MDRVN013
10862|The consolidated assessment report presented immediate humanitarian needs in responding to the challenges posed by drought and saltwater intrusion.|MDRVN013
10863|On 26 April 2016, the Government of Viet Nam launched an appeal for USD 48.5 million to address the on-going serious drought in the south central and south of Viet Nam.|MDRVN013
10864|Apart from releasing VND 4 billion (CHF 177,000) from its relief fund, the VNRC was being supported by the IFRC – through DREF – in Ben Tre, Long An, Gia Lai and Ninh Thuan provinces, while the Swiss Red Cross provided support in Ca Mau province.|MDRVN013
10865|An estimated of 2 million people in the southern central, central highlands and Mekong Delta lacked water for drinking and domestic use as consequence of El Nino-induced drought.|MDRVN013
10866|The drought was reported in 22 provinces, of which 10 were affected by both drought and saltwater intrusion.|MDRVN013
10867|The saltwater intrusion experienced was the furthest inland ever recorded.|MDRVN013
10868|In many provinces, salinity was much higher than the acceptable standard for domestic use and aquaculture.|MDRVN013
10869|For instance, the salinity of less than 4o/oo is the limit for the rice to live, less than 2o/oo is the limit for the rice to grow into reproductive stage, while the actual salinity was measured at 7o/oo and sometimes up to 17o/oo in many places in Long An and Ben Tre, which affected the brackish water and freshwater aquaculture.|MDRVN013
10870|Data on needs presented by MARD and UN Viet Nam was as follows:|MDRVN013
10871|No disease outbreaks were reported, with close surveillance was provided by health sector.|MDRVN013
10877|Typhoon Doksuri tore a destructive path across Central Viet Nam on Friday, 15 September 2017, as a Category 1 typhoon with maximum sustained winds of 135 kph (wind gust up to 185 kph), flooding hundreds of thousands of homes, whipping off roofs and knocking out power in the six provinces of Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri and Thua Thien Hue.|MDRVN015
10878|According to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control (CCNDPC), at least 14 people were killed, 112 injured and four others missing after Doksuri swept through Viet Nam during the weekend of the typhoon.|MDRVN015
10879|This typhoon is the tenth to hit Viet Nam this year, and caused widespread rainfall of between 100-250mm in provinces from Thanh Hóa to Th?a Thiên-Hu? and left 1.3 million people without power.|MDRVN015
10880|The typhoon has caused severe damage not only to civil properties but also to community infrastructure such as schools, public buildings, and river and sea dykes among others.|MDRVN015
10881|On 18 September 2017, the People’s Aid Coordinating Committee (PACCOM) officially convened a meeting of the Disaster Management Working Group (DMWG) to collect information and coordinate the assessment and response efforts to avoid overlap.|MDRVN015
10882|Two joint assessment teams (JATs), of which PDRTs from VNRC local chapters participated, were set up and deployed to the two provinces of Ha Tinh and Quang Binh from 20 to 23 of September to gather more information on early recovery phase needs.|MDRVN015
10898|On 8 October 2017, Tropical Depression 23W was categorized as level orange, with high winds up to 40.27 mph.|MDRVN016
10899|The next day, it tore a destructive path across the northern provinces of Vietnam before making landfall on 10 October.|MDRVN016
10900|While it was not a particularly strong storm, and did not reach to typhoon level, it brought heavy rains, land erosion, and floods to parts of central and northern Vietnam.|MDRVN016
10901|Prolonged heavy rains and floods caused damage to infrastructure, particularly bridges, blocking roads and leaving many communities isolated.|MDRVN016
10902|The situation worsened just after Tropical Depression 23W had passed, Typhoon Khanun passed over the same areas on 16 October.|MDRVN016
10903|Before Typhoon Khanun made its landfall, the water had already been receding in almost all the rivers in the north of Vietnam, but at a slower pace in some of the affected provinces including Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Hoa Binh, Yen Bai, and Son La.|MDRVN016
10904|Among the most affected provinces were Hoa Binh, Yen Bai, and Thanh Hoa with 75 people confirmed dead and dozens injured.|MDRVN016
10922|Typhoon Damrey made landfall in early Saturday morning, 4 November 2017, with winds of up to 135km/h, wreaking havoc in the central and south-central coast of Viet Nam; before entering Cambodia.|MDRVN017
10923|According to the Chief of Office of the National Search and Rescue Committee, Typhoon Damrey was the strongest storm to make landfall in Kha´nh Hòa Province and the south-central region in the last 20 years.|MDRVN017
10924|The recorded danger level of Damrey was much higher than the Typhoon Doksuri which pummelled the central region in September 2017.|MDRVN017
10925|According to the National Steering Committee for Department of Natural Disaster Prevention and Control (DNDPC), the typhoon caused the most devastation in nine provinces, of which 122 communes from 12 districts were listed as seriously affected by flooding.|MDRVN017
10926|The typhoon affected a total of 4.3 million people and this included 80,531 pregnant/nursing women and 143,997 children.|MDRVN017
10927|The most affected provinces, including the Central Highlands (Lam Dong, Kon Tum, Dak Lak, and Gia Lai) and the South-Central region (Khanh Hoa, Phu Yen, Binh Dinh, Quang Nam, and Quang Ngai), had high numbers of dead and missing people, with a total of 106 people died, 16 missing, and 174 injured, seriously damaged infrastructure, collapsed/unroofed houses, and some close to 50,000 hectares of crops destroyed (including 8,417 hectares of rice, almost 15,000 hectares of vegetables, and 24,435 agricultural cages), as of 11 November 2017.|MDRVN017
10928|Following the typhoon, 50,000 households were in urgent need of food assistance, and 100,000 households had lost their livelihoods.|MDRVN017
10929|Aquaculture in Viet Nam was also severely affected, with 133,000 hectares of shrimp farms flooded and over 70,000 aquaculture cages swept away.|MDRVN017
10930|The provinces affected by Typhoon Damrey were affected by a series of storms since 2016, weakening household coping capacities, as their productive assets were lost.|MDRVN017
10931|The Government of Viet Nam estimates the economic loss to be USD 630.5 million.|MDRVN017
10932|The People’s Aid Coordinating Committee (PACCOM) called for a coordination meeting with all relevant stakeholders in Viet Nam to update the situation and response plan.|MDRVN017
10933|The meeting was participated by UN agencies, NGOs and the Red Cross Movement.|MDRVN017
10934|PACCOM officially sent out an appeal for assistance to the people affected on 7 November 2017.|MDRVN017
10935|On 9 November 2017, H.E. Mr. Trinh Dinh Dung, Deputy Prime Minister chaired the ad-hoc meeting of the Central Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control (CCNDPC) to discuss in detail on the responses’ operations of the typhoon Damrey; VNRC leaders and senior officers also attended to the meeting and updated on the emergency responses of the Red Cross.|MDRVN017
10936|The Government of Viet Nam, through CCNDPC and the VietNam Disaster Management Authority (VNDMA) under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) as CCNDPC Secretariat, coordinated the response in the affected provinces and at the national level.|MDRVN017
10937|At the end of November, the UN in Viet Nam estimated that approx. US$54 million3 humanitarian funding is required for water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), food security and livelihoods, and shelter activities.|MDRVN017
10938|Furthermore, it indicated while relief operations were ongoing, additional financial support is vital to address short, medium and long-term needs to help communities recover from the storm and floods, and strengthen the resilience of affected communities.|MDRVN017
10939|On 14 December 2017, CCNDPC launched the call for supports to help affected provinces in the Central region overcome aftermaths of Damrey Typhoon and other natural disasters in 2017 and stabilize their lives.|MDRVN017
10940|The launch was attended by many international partners in the country including the VNRC.|MDRVN017
10962|In November 2016, the Vanuatu Ministry of Health (MoH) observed an increase in the reported number of dengue fever cases in the country.|MDRVU003
10963|Like other Pacific Island countries and territories, Vanuatu is prone to dengue outbreaks.|MDRVU003
10964|The country has experienced five major outbreaks since 1970, the worst of which occurred in 1989 with over 3,000 admissions and 12 deaths.|MDRVU003
10965|Since the 1989 outbreak, the government has upgraded its surveillance and control system and developed dengue preparedness plans.|MDRVU003
10966|On 30 December 2016, the MoH declared a dengue outbreak and as of 31 May 2017, a total of 2,820 suspected cases had been reported to the MoH during the outbreak period.|MDRVU003
10967|Of these 641 cases were confirmed positive.|MDRVU003
10968|In accordance with the request of the MoH and Vanuatu Red Cross Society (VRCS), this DREF operation was supporting the VRCS to focus on the islands of Emae (Shefa province) and Malekula (Malampa province) where the following number of cases were reported and confirmed as at 31 May 2017:|MDRVU003
10990|On 2 May 2017, the Fiji Meteorological Service provided an early alert for a tropical disturbance (TD21F) forming to the north of Vanuatu.|MDRVU004
10991|Over the ensuing 24 hours TD21F continued to strengthen and by midnight on 3 May 2017 had developed into Tropical Cyclone (TC) Donna, a category 1 system.|MDRVU004
10992|Moving in a westerly direction, TC Donna passed north of the Vanuatu group as a category 3 cyclone within 50-100km of the Torres Islands in the Torba province.|MDRVU004
10993|The system continued west before turning south and passing to the west of Sanma, Malampa and Shefa provinces.|MDRVU004
10994|TC Donna was later classified as a category 5 cyclone by the Vanuatu Meteorology and Geohazards Department as it tracked southwards towards New Caledonia sustaining wind speeds of over 215km/hr.|MDRVU004
10995|TC Donna continued towards New Caledonia and was downgraded to a Tropical Low on 11 May 2017.|MDRVU004
11012|On 23 September 2017, the Vanuatu Meteorology & Geo-hazards Department (VMGD) increased the alert level for Monaro Volcano on Ambae Island, Penama province to Level 4; a moderate eruption state.|MDRVU005
11013|A new volcanic cone has formed within one of the two crater lakes (Manaro Vui).|MDRVU005
11014|This alert level indicated that flying rocks and volcanic gas will affect the Red Zone – a 6.5 km radius around the volcano crater.|MDRVU005
11015|Villages located further from the volcano’s crater could expect volcanic hazards, including explosions and ash rain.|MDRVU005
11016|There was also an increased likelihood that ash falls around the island, especially in villages exposed to the prevailing trade winds direction.|MDRVU005
11017|As a result of the volcano’s increased activities, many of the island’s water sources had been contaminated through ash fall and acid rain.|MDRVU005
11018|Acid rain caused damage to food crops and led to food and livelihood insecurity for people living on the island.|MDRVU005
11019|At that level of activity, the VMGD had advised that the volcano’s activity may increase or decrease at any time without warning.|MDRVU005
11020|South, West and North West Ambae experienced ash rain and smoke as a result of the increased Volcano activities.|MDRVU005
11021|An estimated 5,500 people were initially affected; however, loud explosion and further ash rain was experienced throughout the whole island and a decision was made for mass evacuation to nearby islands Maewo, Pentecost (Penama province) and Santo (Sanma province).|MDRVU005
11022|This then meant that the whole island population of approximately 11,000 people (based on the 2009 Census Data) was affected.|MDRVU005
11023|On the 22 November the VMGD had advised that the volcano’s activities have decrease and reduced the level to alert level three.|MDRVU005
11024|The government of Vanuatu has declared the state of emergency and announced the repatriation of the 11,000 people back to Ambae Island.|MDRVU005
11025|The repatriation took seven days, 22 – 27 November 2017 for the whole people to move and settled back on the island.|MDRVU005
11026|On 7 December 2017, the VMGD had advised the volcano alert was reduced to level two.|MDRVU005
11045|In October 2017, the entire population (approximately 11,000 people) of Ambae, an island in the north of the Vanuatu archipelago, were temporarily evacuated due to increased volcanic activity.|MDRVU006
11046|At that time, Vanuatu Red Cross (VRCS) launched a DREF emergency response which was successful in reaching all displaced people.|MDRVU006
11047|Assistance was provided in the form of distribution of non-food items (NFI), evacuation camp support, beneficiary registration and community awareness campaigns.|MDRVU006
11048|The population returned to their island on the 22 October 2017 after three weeks living in evacuation centres and camps.|MDRVU006
11049|The volcano’s activity was then downgraded to level 2.|MDRVU006
11050|On the 18 March 2018, the volcano alert level was raised again to level 3 and populations in West and South Ambae reported experiencing heavy ash fall which caused some local-style structures to collapse, contaminated water sources and destroyed food gardens.|MDRVU006
11051|The government re-evacuated 606 people from the South of Ambae and moved them to evacuation centres in East Ambae, others evacuated voluntarily from the island.|MDRVU006
11052|Increased ash fall in April saw houses, other structures and trees collapse under the weight of the ash.|MDRVU006
11053|Large fallen trees blocked road access to some communities in the North, while dangerous landslides believed to be linked to the heavy deposits of ashfall destroyed an entire village.|MDRVU006
11054|On the 12 April, the Council of Ministers declared a State of Emergency (SOE) for the entire island of Ambae for a period of 3 months.|MDRVU006
11055|The SOE also came with indication of the plan by the National government to assist with voluntary evacuations up until 30 April.|MDRVU006
11056|After this, they planned for mandatory evacuations over a 2-week period until 15 May.|MDRVU006
11057|Following this initial decision, resistance from the provincial government and a reduction in the severity of the effects of the volcano prompted the government to revise their decision to allow for voluntary evacuation rather than mandatory.|MDRVU006
11058|However, in mid-July the volcano’s activity increased again and on the 21 July, the level was again increased to level 3.|MDRVU006
11059|This prompted the government to order the compulsory evacuation of the entire island.|MDRVU006
11060|During the first week of August, the people of Ambae were either evacuated to nearby Maewo island by the government or chose to make their own way to the island of Santo.|MDRVU006
11061|Approximately 2,600 evacuees relocated to Maewo and 6,500 to Santo.|MDRVU006
11082|On 7 November 2016, several areas of Kosovo1 were flooded as a result of heavy rainfalls.|MDRXK001
11083|The rainfall’s intensity was approximately between 20-25 mm per three hours or 60-75 mm per 24 hours.|MDRXK001
11084|By 11 November 2016, its intensity reached a record level of 65-90 mm within 24 hours.|MDRXK001
11085|In the five municipalities of Vushtrri, Gjakova, Rahovec, Podujeva and Malisheva, the situation became critical.|MDRXK001
11086|Affected families lost winter food reserves and livestock, home furniture and appliances.|MDRXK001
11087|Many families had to be evacuated and accommodated in schools.|MDRXK001
11088|Power and water supply stations were flooded cutting many areas from electricity and drinking water.|MDRXK001
11089|Most of the evacuated families found shelter at relatives, helping prevent that family separation cases occur.|MDRXK001
11159|On 13 and 14 April, 2016, heavy rainfall caused heavy flooding that swept across various governorates in Yemen killing at least 20 people and affecting more than 4,250 families (29,750 people) in six governorates (Hodeidah, Amran, Hajjah, Sana'a, Abyan, Al Mahwit, and Marib).|MDRYE005
11160|The floods caused severe damage to vital infrastructure, property, livestock and crops.|MDRYE005
11161|Security officials reported that small dams have also collapsed as a result including two in Hajjah and Amran governorates.|MDRYE005
11162|The affected people were in urgent need for shelter, food, non-food items (NFIs), water, sanitation, hygiene (WASH), and health assistance.|MDRYE005
11163|The most affected governorates were Abyan, Amran, Hajjah, and Hodeidah.|MDRYE005
11164|Some districts within these three governorates were severely affected including districts of Amran, Jabal Yazid, Sharis, Bait Qodam, Al Zuhrah, and Al Luhayah.|MDRYE005
11165|In Amran governorate the two districts of Amran and Jabal Yazid were severely affected.|MDRYE005
11166|It was estimated that more than 800 families in Amran district, and 220 families in Jabal Yazid district were left without shelter as a result of the destruction of their houses by the floods.|MDRYE005
11167|There was widespread destruction of both asphalt and dirt roads, cutting off thousands of people, drowning of livestock including cattle and chicken, spread of garbage all over the flooded areas and contaminating water sources.|MDRYE005
11168|A needs assessment and registration of the affected families was conducted.|MDRYE005
11169|Over 200 families have been severely affected and lost their homes and were moved to 7 schools.|MDRYE005
11170|In Hajjah, local authorities reported 14 people were killed in Sharis District, 100 to 150 households (350 people) displaced, 21 houses were fully damaged and 250 houses partially damaged.|MDRYE005
11171|Reports also indicated that 400 to 500 households were in need of immediate health, WASH, Shelter/NFI and food assistance.|MDRYE005
11172|In Al Hudaydah approximately 150 families were displaced and were living in open areas.|MDRYE005
11173|Assessment reports indicate that there has been loss of human lives, properties, livelihood, and public infrastructure.|MDRYE005
11174|The most affected were farms, public services, markets, houses, schools, etc.|MDRYE005
11175|The impact of the flash flood was further aggravated by the ongoing armed conflict and lack of basic services and limited capacity of disaster response and preparedness.|MDRYE005
11176|The infrastructure has been damaged especially bridges and highways which were already affected by airstrikes.|MDRYE005
11177|Although the disaster hit seven governorates, the level of devastation varied considerably from one place to another.|MDRYE005
11178|Malaria and dengue fever were expected to be spreading, so awareness sessions were included in the plan.|MDRYE005
11179|Netherlands Red Cross contributed to DREF for this operation.|MDRYE005
11180|The CHF 8,283 remaining allocation will be returned to DREF.|MDRYE005
11232|The Western Cape Province of South Africa experienced storms which affected Cape Town and surrounding areas.|MDRZA007
11233|An intense cold front affected the Western Cape from the 7th to the 8th of June 2017.|MDRZA007
11234|Very high and rough sea conditions persisted the entire coastline where the South Africa’s west and south-west coast experienced the brunt of the damaging wave conditions.|MDRZA007
11235|Along with the extreme wind and wave conditions, heavy rainfall and flash flooding occurred in the Cape Town areas as rain spread over the eastern parts of the Western Cape and central Northern Cape with only isolated showers in the south coastal areas.|MDRZA007
11236|From the 5th of July 2017 the South African Weather Services issued an alert of the impending intense cold front with potential for rough seas, heavy rainfall storm surges, snow falls, flash floods in West and South West of Cape Coast.|MDRZA007
11237|Upon receiving this alert the SARCS immediately activated response tools in readiness to provide assistance to potential victims in Cape Town.|MDRZA007
11238|The various organs for response also started activating preparedness for responses measures including the safety measures through various social media platforms.|MDRZA007
11239|On the 7th of July the predicted storm sages and wind gusts with speeds of 100km/ph ravaged Cape Town and other coastal areas causing damages to infrastructure, falling trees and eight (8) fatalities.|MDRZA007
11240|As the fierce storm took hold in the Cape Town area, large parts of Knysna, Brenton-on-Sea, Buffalo Bay and surrounds, and parts of Plettenberg Bay, went up in flames.|MDRZA007
11241|The fires started as a result of strong gale force winds which resulted from the storms and an electrical spark.|MDRZA007
11242|The severity of the situation became apparent when fire fighters despite all efforts could not extinguish the fires and by then 26 fires were identified in residential areas in and around Knysna.|MDRZA007
11243|The fires affected infrastructure in Knysna and communication systems.|MDRZA007
11244|The water supply to the town was completely severed as the fire department required all the water to fight the 26 fires.|MDRZA007
11245|Electricity in the towns were cut to guard against further electrical fires.|MDRZA007
11246|The gale force winds however proved to be challenging and the fires raged on and resparked small fires that were previously dealt with.|MDRZA007
11247|A call went out from the Eden District Disaster Management for help from other Municipalities and volunteer fire fighters.|MDRZA007
11248|Over 1,000 firefighters were engaged and eventually they brought the fires under control.|MDRZA007
11249|Undeclared number people were evacuated, and nine people died due to the fires.|MDRZA007
11250|Residents were evacuated to 13 halls and churches for their safety.|MDRZA007
11251|Households especially those who lived in informal settlements lost their property to the fire making their situation dire.|MDRZA007
11252|As the magnitude of this fire emergency was exacerbated, the Government of South Africa declared a state of national disaster and subsequently launched a Domestic and International Appeal for Humanitarian Assistance.|MDRZA007
11253|The SA Government estimated that approximately 300 million was required to address emergency, medium, and long-term needs associated with the fire emergency.|MDRZA007
11254|Some of the funding has been received and the Government and various partners have started delivery of services to affected areas.|MDRZA007
11255|SARCS along with the Government, NGO’s and Partners have also received funding from the various sources to cover the remaining humanitarian gaps.|MDRZA007
11256|Sequel to this impact, the SARCS with support from IFRC launched a DREF for CHF 140,855 on 19 June 2017 to support the NS to do a detailed needs assessment, replenish relief supplies to the affected population used by SARCS ( NS).|MDRZA007
11257|The major donors and partners of the DREF include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), AECID, the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRZA007
11258|On behalf of the South Africa Red Cross Society (SARCS), the IFRC extends its gratitude to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRZA007
11268|On 20 January 2015, following the death of Zambia’s fifth republican President H.E Michael Chilufya Sata, Zambia held Presidential by-elections.|MDRZM009
11269|Official election campaigns were launched on 12 November, 2015 a day after the burial of the late Republican President.|MDRZM009
11270|In the run-up to the elections some political commentators predicted violence as reported levels of violence increased.|MDRZM009
11271|The predictions were based on the various pockets of violence that took place in the country where some cadres were killed.|MDRZM009
11272|Zambia has experienced some political violence during past elections.|MDRZM009
11273|On 15 January 2015, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) released CHF 29,814 from its Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to ensure that Zambia Red Cross Society (ZRCS) was prepared to meet the immediate needs of populations affected by election related violence if and when it should occur, with activities planned for a period of two months.|MDRZM009
11274|Nonetheless, the by-elections were generally peaceful, with no reported incidences of violence; however tensions mounted when the results announcements began.|MDRZM009
11275|The initial slow pace in announcing the results caused significant anxiety among the opposition supporters as they suspected the delay was deliberate in order to allow tampering of results, in favour of the ruling party.|MDRZM009
11276|Moreover, results began to be announced, despite voting in polling stations in remote arrears still being cast.|MDRZM009
11277|The voting, which was planned for one day, was extended by three days.|MDRZM009
11278|In addition, the Electoral Commission of Zambia (ECZ) encountered challenges delivering ballot papers to some polling stations due to heavy downpours of rain, which made roads inaccessible and led to discontent from the opposition United Party for National Development (UPND).|MDRZM009
11279|The UPND sought an audience with the ECZ, a move that led to further delays in announcing election results.|MDRZM009
11280|More than five million Zambians were eligible to vote during the elections.|MDRZM009
11281|The total votes cast were 1,671,662 representing a voter turnout of 32.36 per cent.|MDRZM009
11310|The situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) continued to deteriorate leading to a continuous streaming of refugees into Zambia.|MDRZM010
11311|The influx continued to increase and since end of August 2017.|MDRZM010
11312|Zambia has been receiving new arrivals from the DRC, mainly from Pweto in Haute Katanga and Moba, in Tanganyika provinces.|MDRZM010
11313|The main cause of Congolese refugees fleeing was conflict and violation of human rights in the DRC as Government soldiers fight militias that have sprung up in Eastern DRC.|MDRZM010
11314|While most of the new arrivals entered through the Chiengi border area, some were also crossing into Zambia through other entry points, such as Nsumbu, Kaputa and Mpulungu as well as Kipushi and Kakoma, in North Western, Kasumbalesa and Sakania, in the Copperbelt province.|MDRZM010
11315|Some went directly to Lusaka.|MDRZM010
11316|Refugees from Kaputa were relocated to Kenani Transit Centre in Nchelenge district although most of the refugees in Kenani Transit Centre were those that entered Zambia through Chienge Reception Centre.|MDRZM010
11317|On 26 September 2017, the IFRC launched a DREF operation for CHF 270,909 to support 1,400 households (7,000 people) through provision of immediate Shelter, Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), and Health needs.|MDRZM010
11318|On 27 November 2017, an Operation update was published, revising the operation budget downwards to CHF 267,300 following a reallocation of costs.|MDRZM010
11319|In addition, following the reallocation of costs which enabled the operation to make savings, new activities were proposed, in addition to those planned in the initial EPoA. With Kenani Transit centre having reached its maximum capacity, a new settlement area, Mantapala Settlement was opened about 140 km away from Chiengi the main border entry-point further inland.|MDRZM010
11320|The plan of Government/UNHCR was to support the refugees with access to better livelihood options further inland in Mantapala, away from the border.|MDRZM010
11321|Each household with an interest in Agriculture will be allocated with a piece of farm land.|MDRZM010
11322|With funding support from IFRC (Disaster Response Emergency Fund DREF), ZRCS procured 840 tarpaulins which were distributed to Refugees in Kenani and Mantapala in coordination with UNHCR.|MDRZM010
11323|The other tarpaulins (5400) were supplied with support from Netherlands Red Cross (NLRC) and 360 of these were distributed to the four (04) Border Reception Centres namely (Chienge, Nsumbu, Kaputa, and Mpulungu) while the remaining 5040 were distributed in Mantapala.|MDRZM010
11324|Relocation of refugees from Kenani Camp to Mantapala Refugee Settlement started in January 2018.|MDRZM010
11325|At the time of reporting eight (8) convoys were used to relocate 2,728 refugees to Mantapala Settlement coordinated by UNHCR protection.|MDRZM010
11326|The relocation is still ongoing today.|MDRZM010
11327|The statistics provided by the UNHCR and CoR, as at 28th February 2018, indicated a cumulative total of 15,156 individuals from DRC comprising 4,910 households which have been biometrically registered at Kenani Transit centre in Nchelenge since 30th August 2017.|MDRZM010
11328|Out of the total, there were 3,128 (1,970 females and 1,158 Males) vulnerable people.|MDRZM010
11329|Some 1,310 people with special needs (PSNs) aged between 18-59 made up the majority and dominant category.|MDRZM010
11330|The unaccompanied or separated children were 1,404 (689 girls and 715 boys).|MDRZM010
11331|Children at risk were 125 (64 girls and 61 boys); Disabled people were 141 (63 females and 78 males); Older people at risk were 117 (91 females and 26 males); people with serious medical condition were 48 (27 females and 21 males); Single parents were 806 (682 females and 124 males).|MDRZM010
11332|The major donors and partners of the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), AECID, the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRZM010
11333|On behalf of the Zambia Red Crescent Society (ZRCS), the IFRC would like to extend its gratitude to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRZM010
11350|Cholera is endemic to Zambia and outbreaks occur almost every year in Lusaka, Southern, Northern and Luapula provinces.|MDRZM011
11351|The 2017/2018 cholera outbreak was declared on 6th October 2017 after a laboratory confirmation of two initial cases reported by Chipata Level One Hospital on 4th October 2017.|MDRZM011
11352|This year, the outbreak happened just before the rainy season which is unusual, but it followed a period of inadequate water supply during the summer period.|MDRZM011
11353|With inadequate water supply more people are forced to use unsafe water.|MDRZM011
11354|This was the main driver of the recent outbreak.|MDRZM011
11355|By December 2017, the outbreak spread to other parts of Lusaka namely: Garden Chilulu, Kabanana, Ngombe, Chipata, Kanyama, Chibolya, Bauleni, Matero, Mazyopa, John Laing, Makeni villa, Chazanga, Jack, Mandevu, Kuomboka, Zingalume, Twikatane, Chunga, and Zanimuwone with Chipata and Kanyama being the most affected.|MDRZM011
11356|As such, on 15 December 2017, IFRC launched a DREF operation for CHF 222,351 to contribute to the reduction of mortality and morbidity linked to cholera disease outbreak within the affected communities of Lusaka province, through the provision of health services, clean and safe water supply, sanitation and hygiene activities to about 70,000 people (14,000 households).|MDRZM011
11357|With intensification of the rains, new cases raised on a daily basis reaching a peak on the first week of January 2018 with over 700 cases reported (See figure 1).|MDRZM011
11358|As the results of robust intervention by the government and its partners, including ZRCS, the epidemic declined significantly between epidemiological weeks 2 and 5 (2018) recording about 100 new cases per day by end of February 2018.|MDRZM011
11359|Nonetheless, cholera cases started to rise again in epidemiological week 10 recording more than 200 cases.|MDRZM011
11360|In response, an Operation Update was published on 06 March 2018, summarizing the progress made and the new needs on the ground and extending the operation timeframe until 18 April 2018.|MDRZM011
11361|The Operation update also revised the number of targeted people from 70,000 to 200,000 and the operation was granted an additional allocation of CHF 26,354, to support supplementary costs for volunteer incentives as they conducted door to door hygiene promotion.|MDRZM011
11362|The overall budget for this operation was thus brought to CHF 248,705.|MDRZM011
11363|Thanks to this response operation, as well as the commitment of ZRCS volunteers and partners of the ZRCS, the outbreak started decreasing continuously from end of March to May 2018 when new cases were recorded in single digits.|MDRZM011
11364|By 25th March 2018 when DREF operation activities were being rounded up, Lusaka recorded 19 new cases with a cumulative total of 4,768 and 89 deaths while national cumulative totals were 5,190 new cases and 103 deaths1.|MDRZM011
11365|Looking at the current trend of the epidemic, supported by trends2 from previous years, the 2017/18 cholera outbreak in Zambia was confirmed combated by end of May 2018.|MDRZM011
11366|With the outbreak showing signs of being contained, the government, through the Ministry of Health started to loosen some restrictions, e.g. the National Heroes stadium which was the main cholera treatment centre (CTC), has ceased its activities and reverted to its usual purpose.|MDRZM011
11367|The figure below is a histogram showing the number of reported cholera cases and related events, by week, in Lusaka, Zambia, during October 2017–May 2018.|MDRZM011
11368|The major donors and partners of the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) include the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), AECID, the Medtronic and Zurich Foundations and other corporate and private donors.|MDRZM011
11369|On behalf of the Zambia Red Crescent Society (ZRCS), the IFRC would like to extend its gratitude to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRZM011
11423|From December 2014, Zimbabwe experienced continuous heavy rainfall, which led to widespread flooding across the country, with the worst affected provinces including: Manicaland, Mashonaland Central, Mashonaland East, Mashonaland West and Midlands.|MDRZW010
11424|According to preliminary assessments, approximately 6,000 people (1,200 households) were affected, of which 2,500 people (500 households) were identified as in urgent need of assistance.|MDRZW010
11425|Many houses collapsed due to flooding, belongings were washed away including food and livelihoods items, and water and sanitation infrastructures contaminated.|MDRZW010
11426|In January 2015, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) released CHF 192,292 from the Disaster Relief and Emergency Fund (DREF) to support the Zimbabwe Red Cross respond to the immediate needs of the affected population, with emergency food, relief, shelter assistance, water, sanitation and hygiene promotion in Manicaland, Mashonaland Central, Mashonaland East, Mashonaland West and Midlands provinces; over a period of three months.|MDRZW010
11427|98 per cent of the activities have been completed.|MDRZW010
11428|An extension of one month was approved in order to carry out a DREF operational review/lessons learned exercise.|MDRZW010
11429|This operational review/lessons learnt was originally intended to be carried out the week commencing 22 March 2015,however it had to be postponed until the 20 April 2015.|MDRZW010
11430|This was due to unavailable resources from ZRCS and ODK equipment that was required to carry out beneficiary satisfaction survey.|MDRZW010
11431|The IFRC zone office and southern Africa regional office (SARO) developed a Terms of Reference and team members were identified from Disaster Management and PMER units.|MDRZW010
11432|A representative from British Red Cross also participated in this exercise.|MDRZW010
11433|As part of the operational review/lessons learnt, refresher training on the use of ODK technologies for ZRCS volunteers was done in the field a day before the exercise, thus it was used to carry out the beneficiary satisfaction survey.|MDRZW010
11434|The DREF operation was completed by 12 May 2015.|MDRZW010
11435|This DREF was partially replenished by DG ECHO.The major donors and partners of the DREF included the Red Cross Societies and governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the USA, as well as DG ECHO, the UK Department for International Development (DFID) the Medtronic, Zurich and Coca Cola Foundations.|MDRZW010
11436|The IFRC, on behalf of the Zimbabwe Red Cross Society would like to extend many thanks to all partners for their generous contributions.|MDRZW010
11446|Between January and March 2017, Zimbabwe experienced severe flooding across 37 districts of the country, which damaged local infrastructure, livelihoods, transportation routes, and homes.|MDRZW012
11447|The above-average precipitation during this period was exacerbated by the rains brought about by tropical depression “Ex-Dineo”, which caused significant flooding particularly in the southern parts of Zimbabwe.|MDRZW012
11448|Originating from the Mozambique Channel, Tropical Cyclone Dineo (CAT I) made landfall in Mozambique on 15 February 2017 near Inhambane, southern Mozambique bringing with it strong winds exceeding 100km/hr, torrential rain, and very rough seas.|MDRZW012
11449|The system was down-graded to a tropical depression upon making landfall, however it continued its trajectory westwards and entered Zimbabwean territory on 16 February.|MDRZW012
11450|From Zimbabwe Red Cross’ initial rapid, multi-sectoral assessment, some 12,772 individuals were identified as being directly affected by the flooding resultant from Cyclone Dineo.|MDRZW012
11451|However, the UN Resident Coordinator’s Office estimated that between January and March 2017, some 160,000 people have been impacted by floods, which has resulted in nearly 2,000 displaced 859 of whom are displaced to a camp in Tsholostho in Matabeleland North.|MDRZW012
11452|Nearly 2,600 houses were damaged and 126 people were killed and 128 injured by the weather vagaries linked to the cyclone such as landslides, rock falls and lightening and drowning.|MDRZW012
11453|Additionally, more than 140 community and privately owned dams breached resulting in damage to downstream infrastructure, especially in Matabeleland (South and North) and Midlands Provinces.|MDRZW012
11454|Nearly all districts experienced damage to roads and collapsed bridges, rending the areas inaccessible.|MDRZW012
11455|Over 15 public/social service infrastructure inclusive of health institutions and schools were destroyed or damaged compromising access to and delivery of critical social services.|MDRZW012
11456|The Government estimated that over 100,000 people were without safe drinking water following damage to water supply infrastructure by the floods.|MDRZW012
11457|This increased potential for the outbreak of water and vector borne diseases including malaria, cholera and measles.|MDRZW012
11458|More than 90 per cent of small-scale miners in heavily affected areas lost their livelihoods as mine working were inundated in water.|MDRZW012
11459|As the magnitude of this flood emergency, exacerbated by TD Ex-Dineo, exceeded the capacity of national resources to address, on 3 March 2016, the Government of Zimbabwe (GoZ) declared a state of national disaster and subsequently launched a Domestic and International Flood Appeal for Humanitarian Assistance.|MDRZW012
11460|The GoZ estimated that USD 189 million is required to address emergency, medium, and long-term needs associated with the flood emergency.|MDRZW012
11461|Some of the funding has been received and the GoZ and various partners have started delivery of services to affected areas.|MDRZW012
11462|ZRCS along with the shelter cluster members, IOM and World Vision International have also received funding from the Central Emergency Response Fund to cover the remaining humanitarian gaps.|MDRZW012
11463|Sequel to this impact, IFRC launched a DREF for CHF 108,204 on 22 February 2017 to support the NS to an initial rapid needs assessment, deliver relief supplies to the affected population, and replenish Zimbabwe Red Cross Society stock.|MDRZW012
11464|During the course of this operation, the NS issued two operational updates which extended the timeframe of the operation from the original Jan-March 2017 to January to May 2017.|MDRZW012
11465|The revision followed an Emergency Needs Assessment (ENA) which was conducted in five provinces and ascertained the extent of the damage and related needs and thus sought to allow the NS to complete the provision of humanitarian services to the people affected and finalizing the stock replenishment.|MDRZW012
11466|The one month extension was also to allow for international procurement of the outstanding stock to be undertaken.|MDRZW012
11467|Consequently, the budget was also revised to CHF 102,992 reflecting the actual needs and the cost of items that were used for distributions.|MDRZW012
